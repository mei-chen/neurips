                        <p><p>This paper presents a new optimization approach to causal estimation. Given data that contains covariates and an outcome, which covariates are causes of the outcome, and what is the strength of the causality? In classical machine learning (ML), the goal of optimization is to maximize predictive accuracy. However, some covariates might exhibit a non-causal association with the outcome. Such spurious associations provide predictive power for classical ML, but they prevent us from causally interpreting the result. This paper proposes CoCo, an optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between pure prediction and causal inference. CoCo leverages the recently-proposed idea of environments, datasets of covariates/response where the causal relationships remain invariant but where the distribution of the covariates changes from environment to environment. Given datasets from multiple environments—and ones that exhibit sufficient heterogeneity—CoCo maximizes an objective for which the only solution is the causal solution. We describe the theoretical foundations of this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated and real datasets. Compared to classical ML and existing methods, CoCo provides more accurate estimates of the causal model and more accurate predictions under interventions.</p>

                        <p>Unobserved discrete data are ubiquitous in many scientific disciplines, and how to learn the causal structure of these latent variables is crucial for uncovering data patterns. Most studies focus on the linear latent variable model or impose strict constraints on latent structures, which fail to address cases in discrete data involving non-linear relationships or complex latent structures. To achieve this, we explore a tensor rank condition on contingency tables for an observed variable set $\mathbf{X}_p$, showing that the rank is determined by the minimum support of a specific conditional set (not necessary in $\mathbf{X}_p$) that d-separates all variables in $\mathbf{X}_p$. By this, one can locate the latent variable through probing the rank on different observed variables set, and further identify the latent causal structure under some structure assumptions. We present the corresponding identification algorithm and conduct simulated experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. In general, our results elegantly extend the identification boundary for causal discovery with discrete latent variables and expand the application scope of causal discovery with latent variables.</p>

                        <p><p>Imitation learning enables an agent to learn from expert demonstrations when the performance measure is unknown and the reward signal is not specified. Standard imitation methods do not generally apply when the learner and the expert's sensory capabilities mismatch and demonstrations are contaminated with unobserved confounding bias. To address these challenges, recent advancements in causal imitation learning have been pursued. However, these methods often require access to underlying causal structures that might not always be available, posing practical challenges.In this paper, we investigate robust imitation learning within the framework of canonical Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using partial identification, allowing the agent to achieve expert performance even when the system dynamics are not uniquely determined from the confounded expert demonstrations. Specifically, first, we theoretically demonstrate that when unobserved confounders (UCs) exist in an MDP, the learner is generally unable to imitate expert performance. We then explore imitation learning in partially identifiable settings --- either transition distribution or reward function is non-identifiable from the available data and knowledge. Augmenting the celebrated GAIL method (Ho \&amp; Ermon, 2016), our analysis leads to two novel causal imitation algorithms that can obtain effective policies guaranteed to achieve expert performance.</p>

Such entities, or <em>agents,</em> may <em>game</em> model decisions by manipulating their inputs to the model to obtain better outcomes and maximize some utility. We consider a multi-agent setting where the goal is to identify the “worst offenders:” agents that are gaming most aggressively. However, identifying such agents is difficult without knowledge of their utility function. Thus, we introduce a framework in which each agent’s tendency to game is parameterized via a scalar. We show that this gaming parameter is only partially identifiable. By recasting the problem as a causal effect estimation problem where different agents represent different “treatments,” we prove that a ranking of all agents by their gaming parameters is identifiable. We present empirical results in a synthetic data study validating the usage of causal effect estimation for gaming detection and show in a case study of diagnosis coding behavior in the U.S. that our approach highlights features associated with gaming.</p>

Unfortunately, the high computational cost of such models inhibits their widespread use in policy-making settings. Surrogate models can address these computational limitations, but to do so they must behave consistently with the simulator under interventions of interest. In this paper, we build upon recent developments in causal abstractions to develop a framework for learning interventionally consistent surrogate models for large-scale, complex simulation models. We provide theoretical results showing that our proposed approach induces surrogates to behave consistently with high probability with respect to the simulator across interventions of interest, facilitating rapid experimentation with policy interventions in complex systems. We further demonstrate with empirical studies that conventionally trained surrogates can misjudge the effect of interventions and misguide decision-makers towards suboptimal interventions, while surrogates trained for <em>interventional</em> consistency with our method closely mimic the behaviour of the original simulator under interventions of interest.</p>

                        <p><p>The ability to conduct interventions plays a pivotal role in learning causal relationships among variables, thus facilitating applications across diverse scientific disciplines such as genomics, economics, and machine learning. However, in many instances within these applications, the process of generating interventional data is subject to noise: rather than data being sampled directly from the intended interventional distribution, interventions often yield data sampled from a blend of both intended and unintended interventional distributions.We consider the fundamental challenge of disentangling mixed interventional and observational data within linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs) with Gaussian additive noise without the knowledge of the true causal graph. We demonstrate that conducting interventions, whether do or soft, yields distributions with sufficient diversity and properties conducive to efficiently recovering each component within the mixture. Furthermore, we establish that the sample complexity required to disentangle mixed data inversely correlates with the extent of change induced by an intervention in the equations governing the affected variable values. As a result, the causal graph can be identified up to its interventional Markov Equivalence Class, similar to scenarios where no noise influences the generation of interventional data. We further support our theoretical findings by conducting simulations wherein we perform causal discovery from such mixed data.</p>

                        <p>Causal interactions among a group of variables are often modeled by a single causal graph. In some domains, however, these interactions are best described by multiple co-existing causal graphs, e.g., in dynamical systems or genomics. This paper addresses the hitherto unknown role of interventions in learning causal interactions among variables governed by a mixture of causal systems, each modeled by one directed acyclic graph (DAG). Causal discovery from mixtures is fundamentally more challenging than single-DAG causal discovery. Two major difficulties stem from (i) an inherent uncertainty about the skeletons of the component DAGs that constitute the mixture and (ii) possibly cyclic relationships across these component DAGs. This paper addresses these challenges and aims to identify edges that exist in at least one component DAG of the mixture, referred to as the *true* edges. First, it establishes matching necessary and sufficient conditions on the size of interventions required to identify the true edges. Next, guided by the necessity results, an adaptive algorithm is designed that learns all true edges using ${\cal O}(n^2)$ interventions, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Remarkably, the size of the interventions is optimal if the underlying mixture model does not contain cycles across its components. More generally, the gap between the intervention size used by the algorithm and the optimal size is quantified. It is shown to be bounded by the *cyclic complexity number* of the mixture model, defined as the size of the minimal intervention that can break the cycles in the mixture, which is upper bounded by the number of cycles among the ancestors of a node.</p>

                        <p><p>Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is the key to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, traditional causal discovery approaches (CDs) mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations. The lack of well-defined high-level variables in many real-world applications has already been a longstanding roadblock to a broader application of CDs. To this end, this paper presents Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that introduces large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap. LLMs are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in extracting key information from unstructured data. Therefore, it is natural to employ LLMs to assist with proposing useful high-level factors and crafting their measurements. Meanwhile, COAT also adopts CDs to find causal relations among the identified variables as well as to provide feedback to LLMs to iteratively refine the proposed factors. We show that LLMs and CDs are mutually beneficial and the constructed feedback provably also helps with the factor proposal. We construct and curate several synthetic and real-world benchmarks including analysis of human reviews and diagnosis of neuropathic and brain tumors, to comprehensively evaluate COAT. Extensive empirical results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of COAT with significant improvements.</p>

Recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and NewZealand underscore the urgent need for precise flood mapping to guide restorationefforts, understand vulnerabilities, and prepare for future occurrences. WhileSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing offers day-and-night, all-weatherimaging capabilities, its application in deep learning for flood segmentation islimited by the lack of large annotated datasets. To address this, we introduceKuro Siwo, a manually annotated multi-temporal dataset, spanning 43 flood eventsglobally. Our dataset maps more than 338 billion $m^2$ of land, with 33 billiondesignated as either flooded areas or permanent water bodies. Kuro Siwo includesa highly processed product optimized for flood mapping based on SAR GroundRange Detected, and a primal SAR Single Look Complex product with minimalpreprocessing, designed to promote research on the exploitation of both the phaseand amplitude information and to offer maximum flexibility for downstream taskpreprocessing. To leverage advances in large scale self-supervised pretrainingmethods for remote sensing data, we augment Kuro Siwo with a large unlabeled setof SAR samples. Finally, we provide an extensive benchmark, namely BlackBench,offering strong baselines for a diverse set of flood events from Europe, America,Africa, Asia and Australia.</p>

                        <p><p>Fine urban change segmentation using multi-temporal remote sensing images is essential for understanding human-environment interactions in urban areas. Although there have been advances in high-quality land cover datasets that reveal the physical features of urban landscapes, the lack of fine-grained land use datasets hinders a deeper understanding of how human activities are distributed across landscapes and the impact of these activities on the environment, thus constraining proper technique development. To address this, we introduce FUSU, the first fine-grained land use change segmentation dataset for Fine-grained Urban Semantic Understanding. FUSU features the most detailed land use classification system to date, with 17 classes and 30 billion pixels of annotations. It includes bi-temporal high-resolution satellite images with 0.2-0.5 m ground sample distance and monthly optical and radar satellite time series, covering 847 km^2 across five urban areas in the southern and northern of China with different geographical features. The fine-grained land use pixel-wise annotations and high spatial-temporal resolution data provide a robust foundation for developing proper deep learning models to provide contextual insights on human activities and urbanization. To fully leverage FUSU, we propose a unified time-series architecture for both change detection and segmentation. We benchmark FUSU on various methods for several tasks.

                        <p><p>High-quality preference datasets are essential for training reward models that can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality responses aligned with human preferences. As LLMs become stronger and better aligned, permissively licensed preference datasets, such as Open Assistant, HH-RLHF, and HelpSteer need to be updated to remain effective for reward modeling.Methods that distil preference data from proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 have restrictions on commercial usage imposed by model providers.To improve upon both generated responses and attribute labeling quality, we release HelpSteer2, a permissively licensed preference dataset (CC-BY-4.0).  Using a powerful internal base model trained on HelpSteer2, we are able to achieve the SOTA score (91.6%) on Reward-Bench's primary dataset, outperforming currently listed open and proprietary models, as of 5 June 2024. Notably, HelpSteer2 consists of only ten thousand response pairs, an order of magnitude fewer than existing preference datasets (e.g., HH-RLHF), which makes it highly efficient for training reward models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that reward models trained with HelpSteer2 are effective in aligning LLMs. HelpSteer2 is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2 and code is available at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner</p>

                        <p><p>Traditionally, 3d indoor datasets have generally prioritized scale over ground-truth accuracy in order to obtain improved generalization. However, using these datasets to evaluate dense geometry tasks, such as depth rendering, can be problematic as the meshes of the dataset are often incomplete and may produce wrong ground truth to evaluate the details. In this paper, we propose SCRREAM, a dataset annotation framework that allows annotation of fully dense meshes of objects in the scene and registers camera poses on the real image sequence, which can produce accurate ground truth for both sparse 3D as well as dense 3D tasks. We show the details of the dataset annotation pipeline and showcase four possible variants of datasets that can be obtained from our framework with example scenes, such as indoor reconstruction and SLAM, scene editing \&amp; object removal, human reconstruction and 6d pose estimation. Recent pipelines for indoor reconstruction and SLAM serve as new benchmarks. In contrast to previous indoor dataset, our design allows to evaluate dense geometry tasks on eleven sample scenes against accurately rendered ground truth depth maps.</p>

                        <p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks.However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions.Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities.To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents.LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as $\texttt{IsAmbulance}(\texttt{X})$ and $\texttt{IsClose}(\texttt{X}, \texttt{Y})$. These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios.Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning.To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors.Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data.With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI.All the code and data are open-sourced at our website.</p>

In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed GMAI-MMbench, the most comprehensive and fine-grained GMAI benchmark to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 38 medical image modalities, 19 clinical-related tasks, and 18 departments in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified 5 main insufficiencies to be addressed in the next-generation LVLMs. Addressing them can advance the development of cutting-edge LVLMs for medical applications. We believe GMAI-MMbench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</p>

                        <p><p>Evaluating observational estimators of causal effects demands information that is rarely available: unconfounded interventions and outcomes from the population of interest, created either by randomization or adjustment. As a result, it is customary to fall back on simulators when creating benchmark tasks. Simulators offer great control but are often too simplistic to make challenging tasks, either because they are hand-designed and lack the nuances of real-world data, or because they are fit to observational data without structural constraints. In this work, we propose a general, repeatable strategy for turning observational data into sequential structural causal models and challenging estimation tasks by following two simple principles: 1) fitting real-world data where possible, and 2) creating complexity by composing simple, hand-designed mechanisms. We implement these ideas in a highly configurable software package and apply it to the well-known Adult income data set to construct the IncomeSCM simulator. From this, we devise multiple estimation tasks and sample data sets to compare established estimators of causal effects. The tasks present a suitable challenge, with effect estimates varying greatly in quality between methods, despite similar performance in the modeling of factual outcomes, highlighting the need for dedicated causal estimators and model selection criteria.</p>

                        <p><p>The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multi-modal remote sensing data.In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10-50 meters), including more than 10,000 species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) that are traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time-series of climatic variables, and satellite time-series from the Landsat program.In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches.All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</p>

                        <p>Cross-modal (image-to-text and text-to-image) retrieval is an established task used in evaluation benchmarks to test the performance of vision-language models (VLMs). Several state-of-the-art VLMs (e.g. CLIP, BLIP-2) have achieved near-perfect performance on widely-used image-text retrieval benchmarks such as MSCOCO-Test-5K and Flickr30K-Test-1K. As a measure of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, prior works rely on zero-shot performance evaluated on one dataset (Flickr) using a VLM finetuned on another one (MSCOCO). We argue that such comparisons are insufficient to assess the OOD generalization capability of models due to high visual and linguistic similarity between the evaluation and finetuning datasets. To address this gap, we introduce WikiDO (drawn from Wikipedia Diversity Observatory), a novel cross-modal retrieval benchmark to assess the OOD generalization capabilities of pretrained VLMs. This consists of newly scraped 380K image-text pairs from Wikipedia with domain labels, a carefully curated, human-verified a)in-distribution (ID) test set (3K) and b) OOD test set (3K). The image-text pairs are very diverse in topics and geographical locations. We evaluate different VLMs of varying capacity on the \wikido benchmark; BLIP-2 achieves zero-shot performance of $R@1\approx66\%$ on the OOD test set, compared to $\approx$ $81\%$ on COCO and $\approx95\%$ on Flickr. When fine-tuned on WikiDO, the $R@1$ improvement is at most $\approx5\%$ on OOD instances compared to $\approx12\%$ on ID instances. We probe the VLMs with varying finetuning objectives and datasets of varying sizes to identify what aids OOD generalization the most. Our results confirm that WikiDO offers a strong cross-modal benchmark for current VLMs in specifically evaluating for OOD generalization. Our code and benchmark datasets are publicly available at https://neurips-wikido.github.io/WIKIDO/.</p>

                        <p><p>Visual Question Answering~(VQA) is an important task in multimodal AI, which requires models to understand and reason on knowledge present in visual and textual data. However, most of the current VQA datasets and models are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, some datasets extend the text to other languages, either via translation or some other approaches, but usually keep the same images, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we create CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark dataset, designed to cover a rich set of languages and regions, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries in four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and we show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark will serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts towards increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.</p>

Due to the lack of gradient information and the need for sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization is an ideal candidate for these tasks. Several methods for high-dimensional continuous and categorical Bayesian optimization have been proposed recently. However, our survey of the field reveals highly heterogeneous experimental set-ups across methods and technical barriers for the replicability and application of published algorithms to real-world tasks. To address these issues, we develop a unified framework to test a vast array of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization methods and a collection of standardized black-box functions representing real-world application domains in chemistry and biology. These two components of the benchmark are each supported by flexible, scalable, and easily extendable software libraries (poli and poli-baselines), allowing practitioners to readily incorporate new optimization objectives or discrete optimizers.

                        <p>Images are increasingly becoming the currency for documenting biodiversity on the planet, providing novel opportunities for accelerating scientific discoveries in the field of organismal biology, especially with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). We ask if pre-trained VLMs can aid scientists in answering a range of biologically relevant questions without any additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of $12$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs in the field of organismal biology using a novel dataset, VLM4Bio, consisting of $469K$ question-answer pairs involving $30K$ images from three groups of organisms: fishes, birds, and butterflies, covering five biologically relevant tasks. We also explore the effects of applying prompting techniques and tests for reasoning hallucination on the performance of VLMs, shedding new light on the capabilities of current SOTA VLMs in answering biologically relevant questions using images.</p>

                        <p><p>Despite the importance of shape perception in human vision, early neural image classifiers relied less on shape information for object recognition than other (often spurious) features. While recent research suggests that current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit more reliance on shape, we find them to still be seriously limited in this regard. To quantify such limitations, we introduce a dataset that challenges current cutting-edge VLMs to decipher shape information when the shape is represented by an arrangement of visual elements in a scene. Our extensive evaluations reveal that, while these shapes are easily detectable by human annotators, current VLMs struggle to recognize them, indicating important avenues for future work in developing more robust visual perception systems.</p>

                        <p><p>Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</p>

Ensuring its safety on public roads is one of the main duties that requires an accurate perception of the environment. To achieve this, machine learning methods rely on large datasets, but to this day, no such datasets are available for autonomous trucks. In this work, we present MAN TruckScenes, the first multimodal dataset for autonomous trucking. MAN TruckScenes allows the research community to come into contact with truck-specific challenges, such as trailer occlusions, novel sensor perspectives, and terminal environments for the first time. It comprises more than 740 scenes of 20 s each within a multitude of different environmental conditions. The sensor set includes 4 cameras, 6 lidar, 6 radar sensors, 2 IMUs, and a high-precision GNSS. The dataset's 3D bounding boxes were manually annotated and carefully reviewed to achieve a high quality standard. Bounding boxes are available for 27 object classes, 15 attributes, and a range of more than 230 m. The scenes are tagged according to 34 distinct scene tags, and all objects are tracked throughout the scene to promote a wide range of applications. Additionally, MAN TruckScenes is the first dataset to provide 4D radar data with 360° coverage and is thereby the largest radar dataset with annotated 3D bounding boxes. Finally, we provide extensive dataset analysis and baseline results. The dataset, development kit, and more will be available online.</p>

Organoids, specifically, are an active area of research, providing excellent models for human organs and their functions. Automating the quantification of organoids in microscopy images would provide an effective solution to overcome substantial manual quantification bottlenecks, particularly in high-throughput image analysis. However, there is a notable lack of open biomedical datasets, in contrast to other domains, such as autonomous driving, and, notably, only few of them have attempted to quantify annotation uncertainty. In this work, we present MultiOrg a comprehensive organoid dataset tailored for object detection tasks with uncertainty quantification. This dataset comprises over 400 high-resolution 2d microscopy images and curated annotations of more than 60,000 organoids. Most importantly, it includes three label sets for the test data, independently annotated by two experts at distinct time points. We additionally provide a benchmark for organoid detection, and make the best model available through an easily installable, interactive plugin for the popular image visualization tool Napari, to perform organoid quantification.</p>

                        <p><p>Discharge summaries in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are crucial for clinical decision-making, but their length and complexity make information extraction challenging, especially when dealing with accumulated summaries across multiple patient admissions. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing this challenge by efficiently analyzing vast and complex data. Existing benchmarks, however, fall short in properly evaluating LLMs' capabilities in this context, as they typically focus on single-note information or limited topics, failing to reflect the real-world inquiries required by clinicians. To bridge this gap, we introduce EHRNoteQA, a novel benchmark built on the MIMIC-IV EHR, comprising 962 different QA pairs each linked to distinct patients' discharge summaries. Every QA pair is initially generated using GPT-4 and then manually reviewed and refined by three clinicians to ensure clinical relevance. EHRNoteQA includes questions that require information across multiple discharge summaries and covers eight diverse topics, mirroring the complexity and diversity of real clinical inquiries. We offer EHRNoteQA in two formats: open-ended and multi-choice question answering, and propose a reliable evaluation method for each. We evaluate 27 LLMs using EHRNoteQA and examine various factors affecting the model performance (e.g., the length and number of discharge summaries). Furthermore, to validate EHRNoteQA as a reliable proxy for expert evaluations in clinical practice, we measure the correlation between the LLM performance on EHRNoteQA, and the LLM performance manually evaluated by clinicians. Results show that LLM performance on EHRNoteQA have higher correlation with clinician-evaluated performance (Spearman: 0.78, Kendall: 0.62) compared to other benchmarks, demonstrating its practical relevance in evaluating LLMs in clinical settings. EHRNoteQA will be publicly available to support further research and improve LLM evaluation in clinical practice.</p>

                        <p><p>Performance on popular ML benchmarks is highly correlated with model scale, suggesting that most benchmarks tend to measure a similar underlying factor of general model capabilities. However, substantial research effort remains devoted to designing new benchmarks, many of which claim to measure novel phenomena. In the spirit of the Bitter Lesson, we ask whether such effort is wasteful. To quantify this question, we leverage spectral analysis to measure an underlying capabilities component, the direction in benchmark-performance-space which explains most variation in model performance. In an extensive analysis of existing safety benchmarks, we find that variance in model performance on many safety benchmarks is largely explained by the capabilities component. In response, we argue that safety research should prioritize metrics which are not highly correlated with scale. Our work provides a lens to analyze both novel safety benchmarks andnovel safety methods, which we hope will enable future work to make differential progress on safety.</p>

                        <p><p>Continuous tracking of eye movement dynamics plays a significant role in developing a broad spectrum of human-centered applications, such as cognitive skills (visual attention and working memory) modeling, human-machine interaction, biometric user authentication, and foveated rendering. Recently neuromorphic cameras have garnered significant interest in the eye-tracking research community, owing to their sub-microsecond latency in capturing intensity changes resulting from eye movements. Nevertheless, the existing approaches for event-based eye tracking suffer from several limitations: dependence on RGB frames, label sparsity, and training on datasets collected in controlled lab environments that do not adequately reflect real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a dynamic graph-based approach that uses a neuromorphic event stream captured by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) for high-fidelity tracking of pupillary movement. More specifically, first, we present EyeGraph, a large-scale multi-modal near-eye tracking dataset collected using a wearable event camera attached to a head-mounted device from 40 participants -- the dataset was curated while mimicking in-the-wild settings, accounting for varying mobility and ambient lighting conditions. Subsequently, to address the issue of label sparsity, we adopt an unsupervised topology-aware approach as a benchmark. To be specific, (a) we first construct a dynamic graph using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), resulting in a uniform and detailed representation of eye morphology features, facilitating accurate modeling of pupil and iris. Then (b) apply a novel topologically guided modularity-aware graph clustering approach to precisely track the movement of the pupil and address the label sparsity in event-based eye tracking. We show that our unsupervised approach has comparable performance against the supervised approaches while consistently outperforming the conventional clustering approaches.</p>

                        <p><p>Weak supervision (WS) is a popular approach for label-efficient learning, leveraging diverse sources of noisy but inexpensive <em>weak labels</em> to automatically  annotate training data. Despite heavy usage, the value of WS is challenging to benchmark due to its complexity: the knobs involved include data sources, labeling functions (LFs), aggregation techniques, called label models (LMs), and end model pipelines. Existing evaluation suites tend to be limited, focusing on particular components or specialized use cases, or relying on simplistic benchmark datasets with poor LFs, producing insights that may not generalize to real-world settings. We address these by introducing a new benchmark, BoxWRENCH, designed to more accurately reflect <em>real-world usage of WS.</em> This benchmark features (1) higher class cardinality and imbalance, (2) substantial domain expertise requirements, and (3) linguistic variations found in parallel corpora. We improve upon existing benchmark LFs using a rigorous procedure aimed at mimicking real-world settings. In contrast to existing WS benchmarks, we show that in many practical settings  supervised learning requires substantial amounts of labeled data to match WS performance.</p>

Using challenging Linguistic Olympiad puzzles, we evaluate (i) capabilities for in-context identification and generalisation of linguistic patterns in very low-resource or extinct languages, and (ii) abilities to follow complex task instructions. The LingOly benchmark covers more than 90 mostly low-resource languages, minimising issues of data contamination, and contains 1,133 problems across 6 formats and 5 levels of human difficulty. We assess performance with both direct accuracy and comparison to a no-context baseline to penalise memorisation. Scores from 11 state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate the benchmark to be challenging, and models perform poorly on the higher difficulty problems. On harder problems, even the top model only achieved 35.3% accuracy, 21.7% improvement over the no-context baseline. Large closed models typically outperform open models, and in general, the higher resource the language, the better the scores. These results indicate, in absence of memorisation, true multi-step out-of-domain reasoning remains a challenge for current language models.</p>

The absence of such a benchmark leads to insufficient and misleading model evaluations, severely undermining the development of this field. However, the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and inconsistent training and evaluation protocols make conducting rigorous experiments and faithful comparisons among IMDL models challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce IMDL-BenCo, the first comprehensive IMDL benchmark and modular codebase. IMDL-BenCo: i) decomposes the IMDL framework into standardized, reusable components and revises the model construction pipeline, improving coding efficiency and customization flexibility; ii) fully implements or incorporates training code for state-of-the-art models to establish a comprehensive IMDL benchmark; and iii) conducts deep analysis based on the established benchmark and codebase, offering new insights into IMDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards.Specifically, IMDL-BenCo includes common processing algorithms, 8 state-of-the-art IMDL models (1 of which are reproduced from scratch), 2 sets of standard training and evaluation protocols, 15 GPU-accelerated evaluation metrics, and 3 kinds of robustness evaluation. This benchmark and codebase represent a significant leap forward in calibrating the current progress in the IMDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.Code is available at: https://github.com/scu-zjz/IMDLBenCo</p>

To provide comprehensive and practical evaluations of the safety of code agents, we propose RedCode,an evaluation platform with benchmarks grounded in four key principles -- real interaction with systems, holistic evaluation of unsafe code generation and execution, diverse input formats, and high-quality safety scenarios and tests.RedCode consists of two parts to evaluate agents' safety in risky code execution and generation: (1) RedCode-Exec provides challenging code prompts in Python as inputs, aiming to evaluate code agents' ability to recognize and handle unsafe code. We then map the Python code to other programming languages (e.g., Bash) and natural text summaries or descriptions for evaluation, leading to a total of over 4,000 testing instances.We provide 25 types of critical vulnerabilities spanning various domains, such as websites, file systems, and operating systems. We provide a Docker sandbox environment to evaluate the execution capabilities of code agents and design corresponding evaluation metrics to assess their execution results.(2) RedCode-Gen provides 160 prompts with function signatures as input to assess whether code agents will follow instructions to generate harmful code or software.Our empirical findings, derived from evaluating three agents based on various LLMs, provide insights into code agents' vulnerabilities. For instance,  evaluations on RedCode-Exec show that agents are more likely to reject executing unsafe operations on operating system. Unsafe operations described in natural text lead to a lower rejection rate than those in code format. Additionally,  evaluations on RedCode-Gen reveal that more capable base models and agents with stronger overall coding abilities, such as GPT-4, tend to produce more sophisticated and effective harmful software.Our findings highlight the need for stringent safety evaluations for diverse code agents.</p>

We hope that AgentGym can foster research on new design principles for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner.</p>

While several vision and language datasets in remote sensing have been proposed to pursue this goal, they often have significant limitations. Existing datasets are typically tailored to single tasks, lack detailed object information, or suffer from inadequate quality control. To address these issues, we present a versatile vision-language benchmark for remote sensing image understanding, termed VERSAL. This benchmark comprises 29,614 images, with 29,614 human-verified detailed captions, 52,472 object references, and 124,037 question-answer pairs. It facilitates the training and evaluation of vision-language models across a broad spectrum of remote sensing image understanding tasks. We further evaluated state-of-the-art models on this benchmark for three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering. Our work aims to significantly contribute to the development of advanced vision-language models in the field of remote sensing.</p>

This requires robust structural inference methods that can deduce structure from observed behavior. However, existing methods are often domain-specific and lack a standardized, objective comparison framework. We address this gap by benchmarking 13 structural inference methods from various disciplines on simulations representing two types of dynamics and 11 interaction graph models, supplemented by a biological experimental dataset to mirror real-world application. We evaluated the methods for accuracy, scalability, robustness, and sensitivity to graph properties. Our findings indicate that deep learning methods excel with multi-dimensional data, while classical statistics and information theory based approaches are notably accurate and robust. Additionally, performance correlates positively with the graph's average shortest path length. This benchmark should aid researchers in selecting suitable methods for their specific needs and stimulate further methodological innovation.</p>

This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management.

Addressing this limitation, we present Easy2Hard, an innovative collection of 6 benchmark datasets featuring standardized difficulty labels spanning a wide range of domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions, providing a much-needed tool for those in demand of a dataset with varying degrees of difficulty for LLM assessment. We estimate the difficulty of individual problems by leveraging the performance data of many human subjects and LLMs on prominent leaderboards. Harnessing the rich human performance data, we employ widely recognized difficulty ranking systems, including the Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign difficulty scores to problems. The Easy2Hard datasets distinguish themselves from previous collections by incorporating a significantly higher proportion of challenging problems, presenting a novel and demanding test for state-of-the-art LLMs. Through extensive experiments conducted with six state-of-the-art LLMs on the Easy2Hard datasets, we offer valuable insights into their performance and generalization capabilities across varying degrees of difficulty, setting the stage for future research in LLM generalization.</p>

                        <p><p>Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is crucial in today's cybersecurity landscape, providing essential insights to understand and counter the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in diverse applications including cybersecurity, but concerns about their reliability, hallucinations and truthfulness persists. While existing benchmarks provide general evaluations of LLMs, there are no benchmarks that address the practical and applied aspects cybersecurity-specific tasks. To address this gap, we introduce CTIBench, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs performance in cyber threat intelligence. CTIBench includes multiple datasets focused on evaluating knowledge acquired by LLMs in cyber-threat landscape. Our study evaluates several state-of-the-art models on these tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity contexts.</p>

                        <p><p>We present ConceptFactory, a novel scope to facilitate more efficient annotation of 3D object knowledge by recognizing 3D objects through generalized concepts (i.e. object conceptualization), aiming at promoting machine intelligence to learn comprehensive object knowledge from both vision and robotics aspects. This idea originates from the findings in human cognition research that the perceptual recognition of objects can be explained as a process of arranging generalized geometric components (e.g. cuboids and cylinders). ConceptFactory consists of two critical parts: i) ConceptFactory Suite, a unified toolbox that adopts Standard Concept Template Library (STL-C) to drive a web-based platform for object conceptualization, and ii) ConceptFactory Asset, a large collection of conceptualized objects acquired using ConceptFactory suite. Our approach enables researchers to effortlessly acquire or customize extensive varieties of object knowledge to comprehensively study different object understanding tasks. We validate our idea on a wide range of benchmark tasks from both vision and robotics aspects with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the high quality and versatility of annotations provided by our approach.

                        <p><p>AI models are increasingly prevalent in high-stakes environments, necessitating thorough assessment of their capabilities and risks. Benchmarks are popular for measuring these attributes and for comparing model performance, tracking progress, and identifying weaknesses in foundation and non-foundation models. They can inform model selection for downstream tasks and influence policy initiatives. However, not all benchmarks are the same: their quality depends on their design and usability. In this paper, we develop an assessment framework considering 40 best practices across a benchmark's life cycle and evaluate 25 AI benchmarks against it. We find that there exist large quality differences and that commonly used benchmarks suffer from significant issues. We further find that most benchmarks do not report statistical significance of their results nor can results be easily replicated. To support benchmark developers in aligning with best practices, we provide a checklist for minimum quality assurance based on our assessment. We also develop a living repository of benchmark assessments to support benchmark comparability.</p>

                        <p><p>Global semantic 3D understanding from single-view high-resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery is crucial for Earth Observation (EO). However, this task faces significant challenges due to the high costs of annotations and data collection, as well as geographically restricted data availability. To address these challenges, synthetic data offer a promising solution by being easily accessible and thus enabling the provision of large and diverse datasets. We develop a specialized synthetic data generation pipeline for EO and introduce \textit{SynRS3D}, the largest synthetic RS 3D dataset. SynRS3D comprises 69,667 high-resolution optical images that cover six different city styles worldwide and feature eight land cover types, precise height information, and building change masks. To further enhance its utility, we develop a novel multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, \textit{RS3DAda}, coupled with our synthetic dataset, which facilitates the RS-specific transition from synthetic to real scenarios for land cover mapping and height estimation tasks, ultimately enabling global monocular 3D semantic understanding based on synthetic data. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the adaptability and effectiveness of our synthetic dataset and proposed RS3DAda method. SynRS3D and related codes will be available.</p>

                        <p><p>LLMs are increasingly being fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, little research has investigated which specific human values are being operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce an approach for auditing RLHF datasets to examine the human values and ethical paradigms embedded within them. Our approach involves two phases. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through a systematic review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics and then used this taxonomy to manually annotate a section of the RLHF preferences to gain foundational insight into the kinds of human values and ethical paradigms embedded within the RLHF dataset. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the first phase as ground truth labels to train transformer-based models and, using that approach, conducted an automated human values audit of more than 100K RLHF preferences that we contribute via this study. Overall, through these approaches, we discovered the most dominant human values and ethical orientations within the RLHF preference dataset. These findings have significant implications for developing LLMs and AI systems that align with societal values and norms.</p>

                        <p><p>The performance of a large language model (LLM) depends heavily on the quality and size of its pretraining dataset. However, the pretraining datasets for state-of-the-art open LLMs like Llama 3 and Mixtral are not publicly available and very little is known about how they were created. In this work, we introduce FineWeb, a 15-trillion token dataset derived from 96 Common Crawl snapshots that produces better-performing LLMs than other open pretraining datasets. To advance the understanding of how best to curate high-quality pretraining datasets, we carefully document and ablate all of the design choices used in FineWeb, including in-depth investigations of deduplication and filtering strategies. In addition, we introduce FineWeb-Edu, a 1.3-trillion token collection of educational text filtered from FineWeb. LLMs pretrained on FineWeb-Edu exhibit dramatically better performance on knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks like MMLU and ARC. Along with our datasets, we publicly release our data curation codebase and all of the models trained during our ablation experiments.</p>

Recent advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have achieved significant advancements in biomedicine, which have also raised privacy and security challenges. The construction of specialized generalists hinges largely on high-quality datasets, enhanced by techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback, and direct preference optimization. However, these leading technologies (e.g., preference learning) are still significantly limited in the open source community due to the scarcity of specialized data. In this paper, we present the UltraMedical collections, which consist of high-quality manual and synthetic datasets in the biomedicine domain, featuring preference annotations across multiple advanced LLMs. By utilizing these datasets, we fine-tune a suite of specialized medical models based on Llama-3 series, demonstrating breathtaking capabilities across various medical benchmarks. Moreover, we develop powerful reward models skilled in biomedical and general reward benchmark, enhancing further online preference learning within the biomedical LLM community.</p>

This work aims to provide a systematic view of long-tailed learning with regard to three pivotal angles: (A1) the characterization of data long-tailedness, (A2) the data complexity of various domains, and (A3) the heterogeneity of emerging tasks. We develop HeroLT, a comprehensive long-tailed learning benchmark integrating 16 state-of-the-art algorithms, 6 evaluation metrics, and 16 real-world datasets across 5 tasks from 3 domains. HeroLT with novel angles and extensive experiments (313 in total) enables effective and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods compared with existing baselines on varying dataset types. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the significant applications of long-tailed learning and identifying several promising future directions. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark HeroLT and corresponding results at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HeroLT-9746/.</p>

                        <p><p>Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and, therefore, engineered to operate under diverse conditions and failures. The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, we must develop grid analysis algorithms to ensure reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling.

                        <p><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance, empowering the development of large multimodal agents (LMAs). An LMA is anticipated to execute practical tasks requires various capabilities including multimodal perception, interaction, reasoning, and decision making. However, existing benchmarks are limited in assessing compositional skills and actions demanded by practical scenarios, where they primarily focused on single tasks and static scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce WhodunitBench, a benchmark rooted from murder mystery games, where players are required to utilize the aforementioned skills to achieve their objective (i.e., identifying the `murderer' or hiding themselves), providing a simulated dynamic environment for evaluating LMAs. Specifically, WhodunitBench includes two evaluation modes. The first mode, the arena-style evaluation, is constructed from 50 meticulously curated scripts featuring clear reasoning clues and distinct murderers; The second mode, the chain of evaluation, consists of over 3000 curated multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions, aiming to assess every facet of the murder mystery games for LMAs. Experiments show that although current LMAs show acceptable performance in basic perceptual tasks, they are insufficiently equipped for complex multi-agent collaboration and multi-step reasoning tasks. Furthermore, the full application of the theory of mind to complete games in a manner akin to human behavior remains a significant challenge. We hope this work can illuminate the path forward, providing a solid foundation for the future development of LMAs.</p>

                        <p><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with cameras, are employed in a variety of applications such as aerial photography, surveillance and agriculture. Robust detection and tracking of objects are essential for the effective deployment of UAVs. However, existing datasets for drone benchmarks are mainly designed for traditional 2D perception tasks, which restricts the development of real-world applications that require a 3D understanding of the environment. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in single-drone perception, the viewpoints of an individual drone can restrict the perception capability over long distances or in areas with occlusions.To address these challenges, we introduce the UAV3D dataset, designed to advance research in both 3D and collaborative 3D perception for UAVs. UAV3D comprises 1,000 scenes, each of which has 20 frames and fully annotated with 3D bounding boxes on vehicles. We provide the benchmark for four 3D perception tasks: single UAV 3D object detection, single UAV object tracking, collaborative UAVs 3D object detection, and collaborative UAVs object tracking. Our dataset and code are available at https://titan.cs.gsu.edu/~uav3d/.</p>

                        <p><p>It is customary to deploy uniform scalar quantization in the end-to-end optimized Neural image compression methods, instead of more powerful vector quantization, due to the high complexity of the latter. Lattice vector quantization (LVQ), on the other hand, presents a compelling alternative, which can exploit inter-feature dependencies more effectively while keeping computational efficiency almost the same as scalar quantization. However, traditional LVQ structures are designed/optimized for uniform source distributions, hence nonadaptive and suboptimal for real source distributions of latent code space for Neural image compression tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method to overcome this weakness by designing the rate-distortion optimal lattice vector quantization (OLVQ) codebooks with respect to the sample statistics of the latent features to be compressed. By being able to better fit the LVQ structures to any given latent sample distribution, the proposed OLVQ method improves the rate-distortion performances of the existing quantization schemes in neural image compression significantly, while retaining the amenability of uniform scalar quantization.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper introduces the first generalization and adaptation benchmark using machine learning for evaluating out-of-distribution performance of electromyography (EMG) classification algorithms. The ability of an EMG classifier to handle inputs drawn from a different distribution than the training distribution is critical for real-world deployment as a control interface. By predicting the user’s intended gesture using EMG signals, we can create a wearable solution to control assistive technologies, such as computers, prosthetics, and mobile manipulator robots. This new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two major tasks that have utility for building robust and adaptable control interfaces: 1) intersubject classification, and 2) adaptation using train-test splits for time-series. This benchmark spans six datasets, the largest collection of EMG datasets in a benchmark. Among these, a new dataset is introduced, featuring a novel, easy-to-wear high-density EMG wearable for data collection. The lack of open-source benchmarks has made comparing accuracy results between papers challenging for the EMG research community. This new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable resource for analyzing practical measures of out-of-distribution performance for EMG datasets. Our code and data from our new dataset can be found at emgbench.github.io.</p>

However, there's a lack of insight into how these models perform in terms of <em>both events and entities</em>. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-automatic question generation strategy by composing event structures from information extraction (IE) datasets and present the first Multi-hop Event-centric Question Answering (MEQA) benchmark. It contains (1) 2,093 challenging questions that require a diverse range of complex reasoning over entity-entity, entity-event, and event-event relations; (2) corresponding multi-step QA-format event reasoning chain (explanation) which leads to the answer for each question. We also introduce two metrics for evaluating explanations: completeness and logical consistency. We conduct comprehensive benchmarking and analysis, which shows that MEQA is challenging for the latest state-of-the-art models encompassing large language models (LLMs); and how they fall short of providing faithful explanations of the event-centric reasoning process.</p>

                        <p><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are consistently improving at increasingly realistic software engineering (SE) tasks. In real-world software stacks, significant SE effort is spent developing foundational system software like the Linux kernel. Unlike application-level software, a systems codebase like Linux is multilingual (low-level C/Assembly/Bash/Rust); gigantic (&gt;20 million lines); critical (impacting billions of devices worldwide), and highly concurrent (involving complex multi-threading). To evaluate if ML models are useful while developing such large-scale systems-level software, we introduce kGym (a platform) and kBench (a dataset). ThekGym platform provides a SE environment for large-scale experiments on the Linux kernel, including compiling and running kernels in parallel across several virtual machines, detecting operations and crashes, inspecting logs, and querying and patching the code base. We use kGym to facilitate evaluation on kBench, a crash resolution benchmark drawn from real-world Linux kernel bugs.  An example bug in kBench contains crashing stack traces, a bug-reproducer file, a developer-written fix, and other associated data. To understand current performance, we conduct baseline experiments by prompting LLMs to resolve Linux kernel crashes. Our initial evaluations reveal that the best performing LLM achieves 0.72\% and 5.38\% in the unassisted and assisted (i.e. buggy files disclosed to the model) settings, respectively. These results highlight the need for further research to enhance model performance in SE tasks. Improving performance on kBench requires models to master new learning skills, including understanding the cause of crashes and repairing faults, writing memory-safe and hardware-aware code, and understanding concurrency. As a result, this work opens up multiple avenues of research at the intersection of machine learning and systems software.</p>

                        <p>We analyze the sample complexity of full-batch Gradient Descent (GD) in the setup of non-smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization. We show that the generalization error of GD, with common choice of hyper-parameters, can be $\tilde \Theta(d/m+1/\sqrt{m})$, where d is the dimension and m is the sample size. This matches the sample complexity of \emph{worst-case} empirical risk minimizers. That means that, in contrast with other algorithms, GD has no advantage over naive ERMs. Our bound follows from a new generalization bound that depends on both the dimension as well as the learning rate and number of iterations. Our bound also shows that, for general hyper-parameters, when the dimension is strictly larger than number of samples, $T=\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations are necessary to avoid overfitting. This resolves an open problem by Schlisserman et al.23 and Amir er Al.21, and improves over previous lower bounds that demonstrated that the sample size must be at least square root of the dimension.</p>

                        <p><p>We present a unified framework for deriving PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Unlike most previous literature on this topic, our bounds are anytime-valid (i.e., time-uniform), meaning that they hold at all stopping times, not only for a fixed sample size. Our approach combines four tools in the following order: (a) nonnegative supermartingales or reverse submartingales, (b) the method of mixtures, (c) the Donsker-Varadhan formula (or other convex duality principles), and (d) Ville's inequality. Our main result is a PAC-Bayes theorem which holds for a wide class of discrete stochastic processes. We show how this result implies time-uniform versions of well-known classical PAC-Bayes bounds, such as those of Seeger, McAllester, Maurer, and Catoni, in addition to many recent bounds. We also present several novel bounds. Our framework also enables us to relax traditional assumptions; in particular, we consider nonstationary loss functions and non-iid data. In sum, we unify the derivation of past bounds and ease the search for future bounds: one may simply check if our supermartingale or submartingale conditions are met and, if so, be guaranteed a (time-uniform) PAC-Bayes bound.</p>

                        <p><p>In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when considering causal structures and discrete sensitive attributes in learning problems.To address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from the perspectives of causality and individual fairness. We then present the DRO dual formulation as an efficient tool to convert the main problem into a more tractable and computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step in the Min-Max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust learning.</p>

                        <p>As society increasingly relies on AI-based tools for decision-making in socially sensitive domains, investigating fairness and equity of such automated systems has become a critical field of inquiry. Most of the literature in fair machine learning focuses on defining and achieving fairness criteria in the context of prediction, while not explicitly focusing on how these predictions may be used later on in the pipeline. For instance, if commonly used criteria, such as independence or sufficiency, are satisfied for a prediction score $S$ used for binary classification, they need not be satisfied after an application of a simple thresholding operation on $S$ (as commonly used in practice). In this paper, we take an important step to address this issue in numerous statistical and causal notions of fairness. We introduce the notion of a margin complement, which measures how much a prediction score $S$ changes due to a thresholding operation.We then demonstrate that the marginal difference in the optimal 0/1 predictor $\widehat Y$ between groups, written $P(\hat y \mid x_1) - P(\hat y \mid x_0)$, can be causally decomposed into the influences of $X$ on the $L_2$-optimal prediction score $S$ and the influences of $X$ on the margin complement $M$, along different causal pathways (direct, indirect, spurious). We then show that under suitable causal assumptions, the influences of $X$ on the prediction score $S$ are equal to the influences of $X$ on the true outcome $Y$. This yields a new decomposition of the disparity in the predictor $\widehat Y$ that allows us to disentangle causal differences inherited from the true outcome $Y$ that exists in the real world vs. those coming from the optimization procedure itself. This observation highlights the need for more regulatory oversight due to the potential for bias amplification, and to address this issue we introduce new notions of weak and strong business necessity, together with an algorithm for assessing whether these notions are satisfied. We apply our method to three real-world datasets and derive new insights on bias amplification in prediction and decision-making.</p>

                        <p>Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise, particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric condition, namely **$\epsilon$-softmax**, which simply modifies the outputs of the softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. Essentially, ***$\epsilon$-softmax** not only acts as an alternative for the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the loss function.* We  prove theoretically that **$\epsilon$-softmax** can achieve noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss function. Recognizing that **$\epsilon$-softmax**-enhanced losses may slightly reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise.</p>

We adapt tools from causal sensitivity analysis to the FairML context, providing a general framework which (1) accommodates effectively any combination of fairness metric and bias which can be posed in the ``oblivious setting''; (2) allows researchers to investigate combinations of biases, resulting in non-linear sensitivity; and (3) enables flexible encoding of domain-specific constraints and assumptions. Employing this framework, we analyze the sensitivity of the most common parity metrics under 3 varieties of classifier across 12 canonical fairness datasets. Our analysis reveals the striking fragility of fairness assessments to even minor dataset biases. We show that causal sensitivity analysis provides a powerful and necessary toolkit for gauging the informativeness of parity metric evaluations.</p>

                        <p><p>In this study, we undertake a reproducibility analysis of "Learning Fair Graph Representations Via Automated Data Augmentations" by Ling et al. (2022). We assess the validity of the original claims focused on node classification tasks and explore the performance of the Graphair framework in link prediction tasks. Our investigation reveals that we can partially reproduce one of the original three claims and fully substantiate the other two. Additionally, we broaden the application of Graphair from node classification to link prediction across various datasets. Our findings indicate that, while Graphair demonstrates a comparable fairness-accuracy trade-off to baseline models for mixed dyadic-level fairness, it has a superior trade-off for subgroup dyadic-level fairness. These findings underscore Graphair’s potential for wider adoption in graph-based learning. Our code base can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/juellsprott/graphair-reproducibility.</p>

                        <p><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial. This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we (1) Characterize the game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and (2) Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Most open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such as equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profiles are provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. We hope our research provides standardized protocols and serves as a foundation to spur further explorations in the strategic reasoning of LLMs.</p>

                        <p><p>How (dis)similar are the learning trajectories of vision–language models and children? Recent modeling work has attempted to understand the gap between models’ and humans’ data efficiency by constructing models trained on less data, especially multimodal naturalistic data. However, such models are often evaluated on adult-level benchmarks, with limited breadth in language abilities tested, and without direct comparison to behavioral data. We introduce DevBench, a multimodal benchmark comprising seven language evaluation tasks spanning the domains of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ability, with behavioral data from both children and adults. We evaluate a set of vision–language models on these tasks, comparing models and humans not only on accuracy but on their response patterns. Across tasks, models exhibit variation in their closeness to human response patterns, and models that perform better on a task also more closely resemble human behavioral responses. We also examine the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns. DevBench thus provides a benchmark for comparing models to human language development. These comparisons highlight ways in which model and human language learning processes diverge, providing insight into entry points for improving language models.</p>

                        <p><p>Stochastic compositional optimization (SCO) problem constitutes a class of optimization problems characterized by the objective function with a compositional form, including the tasks with known derivatives, such as AUC maximization, and the derivative-free tasks exemplified by black-box vertical federated learning (VFL). From the learning theory perspective, the learning guarantees of SCO algorithms with known derivatives have been studied in the literature. However, the potential impacts of the derivative-free setting on the learning guarantees of SCO remains unclear and merits further investigation. This paper aims to reveal the impacts by developing a theoretical analysis for two derivative-free algorithms, black-box SCGD and SCSC. Specifically, we first provide the sharper generalization upper bounds of convex SCGD and SCSC based on a new stability analysis framework more effective than prior work under some milder conditions, which is further developed to the non-convex case using the almost co-coercivity property of smooth function. Then, we derive the learning guarantees of three black-box variants of non-convex SCGD and SCSC with additional optimization analysis. Comparing these results, we theoretically uncover the impacts that a better gradient estimation brings a tighter learning guarantee and a larger proportion of unknown gradients may lead to a stronger dependence on the gradient estimation quality. Finally, our analysis is applied to two SCO algorithms, FOO-based vertical VFL and VFL-CZOFO, to build the first learning guarantees for VFL that align with the findings of SCGD and SCSC.</p>

We focus on two learning tasks; in the first, the input is vectors of utilities of an action (decision or policy) for individuals in a group and their associated social welfare as judged by a policy maker, whereas in the second, the input is pairwise comparisons between the welfares associated with a given pair of utility vectors. We show that power mean functions are learnable with polynomial sample complexity in both cases, even if the social welfare information is noisy.

For fixed dimensions, we show that even with varying or tuned bandwidth, the ridgeless solution is never consistent and, at least with large enough noise, always worse than the null predictor. For increasing dimension, we give a generic characterization of the overfitting behavior for any scaling of the dimension with sample size. We use this to provide the first example of benign overfitting using the Gaussian kernel with sub-polynomial scaling dimension.

                        <p><p>Statistical learning theory is the foundation of machine learning, providing theoretical bounds for the risk of models learned from a (single) training set, assumed to issue from an unknown probability distribution. In actual deployment, however, the data distribution may (and often does) vary, causing domain adaptation/generalization issues. In this paper we lay the foundations for a `credal' theory of learning, using convex sets of probabilities (credal sets) to model the variability in the data-generating distribution. Such credal sets, we argue, may be inferred from a finite sample of training sets. Bounds are derived for the case of finite hypotheses spaces (both assuming realizability or not), as well as infinite model spaces, which directly generalize classical results.</p>

                        <p>Autoregressively trained transformers have brought a profound revolution to the world, especially with their in-context learning (ICL) ability to address downstream tasks. Recently, several studies suggest that transformers learn a mesa-optimizer during autoregressive (AR) pretraining to implement ICL. Namely, the forward pass of the trained transformer is equivalent to optimizing an inner objective function in-context.However, whether the practical non-convex training dynamics will converge to the ideal mesa-optimizer is still unclear.Towards filling this gap, we investigate the non-convex dynamics of a one-layer linear causal self-attention model autoregressively trained by gradient flow, where the sequences are generated by an AR process $x_{t+1} = W x_t$. First, under a certain condition of data distribution, we prove that an autoregressively trained transformer learns $W$ by implementing one step of gradient descent to minimize an ordinary least squares (OLS) problem in-context. It then applies the learned $\widehat{W}$ for next-token prediction, thereby verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis. Next, under the same data conditions, we explore the capability limitations of the obtained mesa-optimizer. We show that a stronger assumption related to the moments of data is the sufficient and necessary condition that the learned mesa-optimizer recovers the distribution. Besides, we conduct exploratory analyses beyond the first data condition and prove that generally, the trained transformer will not perform vanilla gradient descent for the OLS problem. Finally, our simulation results verify the theoretical results.</p>

                        <p>We develop and analyze data subsampling techniques for Poisson regression, the standard model for count data $y\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we consider the Poisson generalized linear model with ID- and square root-link functions. We consider the method of \emph{coresets}, which are small weighted subsets that approximate the loss function of Poisson regression up to a factor of $1\pm\varepsilon$. We show $\Omega(n)$ lower bounds against coresets for Poisson regression that continue to hold against arbitrary data reduction techniques up to logarithmic factors. By introducing a novel complexity parameter and a domain shifting approach, we show that sublinear coresets with $1\pm\varepsilon$ approximation guarantee exist when the complexity parameter is small. In particular, the dependence on the number of input points can be reduced to polylogarithmic. We show that the dependence on other input parameters can also be bounded sublinearly, though not always logarithmically. In particular, we show that the square root-link admits an $O(\log(y_{\max}))$ dependence, where $y_{\max}$ denotes the largest count presented in the data, while the ID-link requires a $\Theta(\sqrt{y_{\max}/\log(y_{\max})})$ dependence. As an auxiliary result for proving the tightness of the bound with respect to $y_{\max}$ in the case of the ID-link, we show an improved bound on the principal branch of the Lambert $W_0$ function, which may be of independent interest. We further show the limitations of our analysis when $p$th degree root-link functions for $p\geq 3$ are considered, which indicate that other analytical or computational methods would be required if such a generalization is even possible.</p>

We formulate a multi-task optimization problem as a regularization technique to enable single-task models to leverage multi-task learning information. We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets. We finally propose a consistent estimation of training and testing errors, thereby offering a robust foundation for hyperparameter optimization in multi-task regression scenarios. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets in regression and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate improvements on univariate models, incorporating our method into the training loss and thus leveraging multivariate information.</p>

                        <p>Although current large language models are complex, the most basic specifications of the underlying language generation problem itself are simple to state: given a finite set of training samples from an unknown language, produce valid new strings from the language that don't already appear in the training data. Here we ask what we can conclude about language generation using only this specification, without further assumptions. In particular, suppose that an adversary enumerates the strings of an unknown target language L that is known only to come from one of a possibly infinite list of candidates. A computational agent is trying to learn to generate from this language; we say that the agent generates from $L$ in the limit if after some finite point in the enumeration of $L$, the agent is able to produce new elements that come exclusively from $L$ and that have not yet been presented by the adversary. Our main result is that there is an agent that is able to generate in the limit for every countable list of candidate languages. This contrasts dramatically with negative results due to Gold and Angluin in a well-studied model of language learning where the goal is to identify an unknown language from samples; the difference between these results suggests that identifying a language is a fundamentally different problem than generating from it.</p>

                        <p><p>Learn-to-Defer is a paradigm that enables learning algorithms to work not in isolation but as a team with human experts. In this paradigm, we permit the system to defer a subset of its tasks to the expert. Although there are currently systems that follow this paradigm and are designed to optimize the accuracy of the final human-AI team, the general methodology for developing such systems under a set of constraints (e.g., algorithmic fairness, expert intervention budget, defer of anomaly, etc.) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, using a d-dimensional generalization to the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson (d-GNP), we obtain the Bayes optimal solution for learn-to-defer systems under various constraints. Furthermore, we design a generalizable algorithm to estimate that solution and apply this algorithm to the COMPAS, Hatespeech, and ACSIncome datasets. Our algorithm shows improvements in terms of constraint violation over a set of learn-to-defer baselines and can control multiple constraint violations at once. The use of d-GNP is beyond learn-to-defer applications and can potentially obtain a solution to decision-making problems with a set of controlled expected performance measures.</p>

                        <p>Sparse ridge regression problems play a significant role across various domains. To solve sparse ridge regression, Liu et al. (2023) recently propose an advanced algorithm, Scalable Optimal $K$-Sparse Ridge Regression (OKRidge), which is both faster and more accurate than existing approaches. However, the absence of theoretical analysis on the error of OKRidge impedes its large-scale applications. In this paper, we reframe the estimation error of OKRidge as a Primary Optimization ($\textbf{PO}$) problem and employ the Convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT) to simplify the $\textbf{PO}$ problem into an Auxiliary Optimization ($\textbf{AO}$) problem. Subsequently, we provide a theoretical error analysis for OKRidge based on the $\textbf{AO}$ problem. This error analysis improves the theoretical reliability of OKRidge. We also conduct experiments to verify our theorems and the results are in excellent agreement with our theoretical findings.</p>

                        <p><p>Data-driven algorithm design is a promising, learning-based approach for beyond worst-case analysis of algorithms with tunable parameters. An important open problem is the design of computationally efficient data-driven algorithms for combinatorial algorithm families with multiple parameters. As one fixes the problem instance and varies the parameters, the “dual” loss function typically has a piecewise-decomposable structure, i.e. is well-behaved except at certain sharp transition boundaries. Motivated by prior empirical work, we initiate the study of techniques to develop efficient ERM learning algorithms for data-driven algorithm design by enumerating the pieces of the sum dual loss functions for a collection of problem instances. The running time of our approach scales with the actual number of pieces that appear as opposed to worst case upper bounds on the number of pieces. Our approach involves two novel ingredients – an output-sensitive algorithm for enumerating polytopes induced by a set of hyperplanes using tools from computational geometry, and an execution graph which compactly represents all the states the algorithm could attain for all possible parameter values. We illustrate our techniques by giving algorithms for pricing problems, linkage-based clustering and dynamic-programming based sequence alignment.</p>

We build upon recent work in this line of research by considering the setup where, instead of selecting a single algorithm that has the best performance, we allow the possibility of selecting an algorithm based on the instance to be solved, using neural networks. In particular, given a representative sample of instances, we learn a neural network that maps an instance of the problem to the most appropriate algorithm <em>for that instance</em>. We formalize this idea and derive rigorous sample complexity bounds for this learning problem, in the spirit of recent work in data-driven algorithm design. We then apply this approach to the problem of making good decisions in the branch-and-cut framework for mixed-integer optimization (e.g., which cut to add?). In other words, the neural network will take as input a mixed-integer optimization instance and output a decision that will result in a small branch-and-cut tree for that instance. Our computational results provide evidence that our particular way of using neural networks for cut selection can make a significant impact in reducing branch-and-cut tree sizes, compared to previous data-driven approaches.</p>

Much remains to be understood, however, in statistical learning under distribution shifts. This paper focuses on a distribution shift setting where train and test distributions can be related by classes of (data) transformation maps. We initiate a theoretical study for this framework, investigating learning scenarios where the target class of transformations is either known or unknown. We establish learning rules and algorithmic reductions to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), accompanied with  learning guarantees. We obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity in terms of the VC dimension of the class composing predictors with transformations, which we show in many cases is not much larger than the VC dimension of the class of predictors. We highlight that the learning rules we derive offer a game-theoretic viewpoint on distribution shift: a learner searching for predictors and an adversary searching for transformation maps to respectively minimize and maximize the worst-case loss.</p>

In this work, we consider the problem of optimizing second-order smooth and strongly convex functions where the algorithm is only accessible to noisy evaluations of the objective function it queries. We provide the first tight characterization for the rate of the minimax simple regret by developing matching upper and lower bounds. We propose an algorithm that features a combination of a bootstrapping stage and a mirror-descent stage. Our main technical innovation consists of a sharp characterization for the spherical-sampling gradient estimator under higher-order smoothness conditions, which allows the algorithm to optimally balance the bias-variance tradeoff, and a new iterative method for the bootstrapping stage, which maintains the performance for unbounded Hessian.</p>

                        <p><p>Distributed learning is essential to train machine learning algorithms across <em>heterogeneous</em> agents while maintaining data privacy. We conduct an asymptotic analysis of Unified Distributed SGD (UD-SGD), exploring a variety of communication patterns, including decentralized SGD and local SGD within Federated Learning (FL), as well as the increasing communication interval in the FL setting. In this study, we assess how different sampling strategies, such as <em>i.i.d.</em> sampling, shuffling, and Markovian sampling, affect the convergence speed of UD-SGD by considering the impact of agent dynamics on the limiting covariance matrix as described in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Our findings not only support existing theories on linear speedup and asymptotic network independence, but also theoretically and empirically show how efficient sampling strategies employed by individual agents contribute to overall convergence in UD-SGD. Simulations reveal that a few agents using highly efficient sampling can achieve or surpass the performance of the majority employing moderately improved strategies, providing new insights beyond traditional analyses focusing on the worst-performing agent.</p>

                        <p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the growth rate of $H$-consistency bounds (and excess error bounds) for various surrogate losses used in classification. We prove a square-root growth rate near zero for smooth margin-based surrogate losses in binary classification, providing both upper and lower bounds under mild assumptions. This result also translates to excess error bounds. Our lower bound requires weaker conditions than those in previous work for excess error bounds, and our upper bound is entirely novel. Moreover, we extend this analysis to multi-class classification with a series of novel results, demonstrating a universal square-root growth rate for smooth *comp-sum* and *constrained losses*, covering common choices for training neural networks in multi-class classification. Given this universal rate, we turn to the question of choosing among different surrogate losses. We first examine how $H$-consistency bounds vary across surrogates based on the number of classes. Next, ignoring constants and focusing on behavior near zero, we identify *minimizability gaps* as the key differentiating factor in these bounds. Thus, we thoroughly analyze these gaps, to guide surrogate loss selection, covering: comparisons across different comp-sum losses, conditions where gaps become zero, and general conditions leading to small gaps.  Additionally, we demonstrate the key role of minimizability gaps in comparing excess error bounds and $H$-consistency bounds.</p>

Previous work has shown that double descent can occur in the over-parameterized regime and that the standard bias-variance trade-off holds in the under-parameterized regime. These works provide multiple reasons for the existence of the peak. We postulate that the location of the peak depends on the technical properties of both the spectrum as well as the eigenvectors of the sample covariance. We present two simple examples that provably exhibit double descent in the under-parameterized regime and do not seem to occur for reasons provided in prior work.</p>

                        <p><p>Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before updating weights. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is not theoretically well understood. Here, we study the geometry of the PC energy landscape at the inference equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated energy is simply a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Our theory is validated by experiments on both linear and non-linear networks. Based on these and other results, we conjecture that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work suggests that PC inference makes the loss landscape more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the fundamental challenge of scaling PC to deeper models.</p>

We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to all proper metric loss functions (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with improper metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.</p>

                        <p><p>In real-world applications, the distribution of the data, and our goals, evolve over time. The prevailing theoretical framework for studying machine learning, namely probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, largely ignores time. As a consequence, existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of data and goals exhibit poor real-world performance. This paper develops a theoretical framework called"Prospective Learning" that is tailored for situations when the optimal hypothesis changes over time. In PAC learning, empirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be consistent. We develop a learner called Prospective ERM, which returns a sequence of predictors that  make predictions on future data.  We prove that the risk of prospective ERM converges to the Bayes risk under certain assumptions on the stochastic process  generating the data. Prospective ERM, roughly speaking, incorporates time as an input in addition to the data. We show that standard ERM as done in PAC learning, without incorporating time, can result in failure to learn when distributions are dynamic. Numerical experiments illustrate that prospective ERM can learn synthetic and visual recognition problems constructed from MNIST and CIFAR-10.</p>

                        <p>Hypothesis selection, also known as density estimation, is a fundamental problem in statistics and learning theory. Suppose we are given a sample set from an unknown distribution $P$ and a finite class of candidate distributions (called hypotheses) $\mathcal{H} \coloneqq \{H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n\}$. The aim is to design an algorithm that selects a distribution $\hat H$ in  $\mathcal{H}$ that best fits the data. The algorithm's accuracy is measured based on the distance between $\hat{H}$ and $P$ compared to the distance of the closest distribution in $\mathcal{H}$ to $P$ (denoted by $OPT$). Concretely, we aim for $\|\hat{H} - P\|_{TV}$ to be at most $ \alpha \cdot OPT + \epsilon$ for some small $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$. While it is possible to decrease the value of $\epsilon$ as the number of samples increases, $\alpha$ is an inherent characteristic of the algorithm. In fact, one cannot hope to achieve $\alpha < 3$ even when there are only two candidate hypotheses, unless the number of samples is proportional to the domain size of $P$ [Bousquet, Kane, Moran '19]. Finding the best $\alpha$ has been one of the main focuses of studies of the problem since early work of [Devroye, Lugosi '01]. Prior to our work, no algorithm was known that achieves $\alpha = 3$ in near-linear time. We provide the first algorithm that operates in almost linear time ($\tilde{O}(n/\epsilon^3)$ time) and achieves $\alpha = 3$.  This result improves upon a long list of results in hypothesis selection. Previously known algorithms either had worse time complexity, a larger factor  $\alpha$, or extra assumptions about the problem setting.In addition to this algorithm, we provide another (almost) linear-time algorithm with better dependency on the additive accuracy parameter $\epsilon$, albeit with a slightly worse accuracy parameter, $\alpha = 4$.</p>

                        <p>A fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics is that of finding ground states of localHamiltonians. A number of recent works gave provably efficient machine learning (ML) algorithmsfor learning ground states. Specifically, [Huang et al. Science 2022], introduced an approach for learningproperties of the ground state of an $n$-qubit gapped local Hamiltonian $H$ from only $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ datapoints sampled from Hamiltonians in the same phase of matter. This was subsequently improvedby [Lewis et al. Nature Communications 2024], to $\mathcal{O}(\log 𝑛)$ samples when the geometry of the $n$-qubit system is known.In this work, we introduce two approaches that achieve a constant sample complexity, independentof system size $n$, for learning ground state properties. Our first algorithm consists of a simplemodification of the ML model used by Lewis et al. and applies to a property of interest known beforehand. Our second algorithm, which applies even if a description ofthe property is not known, is a deep neural network model. While empirical results showing theperformance of neural networks have been demonstrated, to our knowledge, this is the first rigoroussample complexity bound on a neural network model for predicting ground state properties. We also perform numerical experiments that confirm the improved scaling of our approach compared to earlier results.</p>

                        <p>We study the gradient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) in the over-parameterized setting, where a general GMM with $n>1$ components learns from data that are generated by a single ground truth Gaussian distribution. While results for the special case of 2-Gaussian mixtures are well-known, a general global convergence analysis for arbitrary $n$ remains unresolved and faces several new technical barriers since the convergence becomes sub-linear and non-monotonic. To address these challenges, we construct a novel likelihood-based convergence analysis framework and rigorously prove that gradient EM converges globally with a sublinear rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. This is the first global convergence result for Gaussian mixtures with more than $2$ components. The sublinear convergence rate is due to the algorithmic nature of learning over-parameterized GMM with gradient EM. We also identify a new emerging technical challenge for learning general over-parameterized GMM: the existence of bad local regions that can trap gradient EM for an exponential number of steps.</p>

                        <p>This paper considers the problem of online clustering with bandit feedback. A set of arms (or items) can be partitioned into various groups that are unknown. Within each group, the observations associated to each of the arms follow the same distribution with the same mean vector. At each time step, the agent queries or pulls an arm and obtains an independent  observation from the distribution it is associated to. Subsequent pulls depend on previous ones as well as the previously obtained samples. The agent's task is to uncover the underlying partition of the arms with the least number of arm pulls and with a probability of error not exceeding a prescribed constant $\delta$. The problem proposed finds numerous applications from clustering of variants of viruses to online market segmentation. We present an instance-dependent information-theoretic lower bound on the expected sample complexity for this task, and design a computationally efficient and asymptotically optimal algorithm, namely Bandit Online Clustering  (BOC). The algorithm includes a novel stopping rule for adaptive sequential testing that circumvents the need to exactly solve any NP-hard weighted clustering problem as its subroutines.  We show through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets that BOC's performance matches the lower bound asymptotically, and significantly outperforms a non-adaptive baseline algorithm.</p>

                        <p>In this study, we consider multi-class multi-server asymmetric queueing systems consisting of $N$ queues on one side and $K$ servers on the other side, where jobs randomly arrive in queues at each time. The service rate of each job-server assignment is unknown and modeled by a feature-based Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) function. At each time, a scheduler assigns jobs to servers, and each server stochastically serves at most one job based on its preferences over the assigned jobs. The primary goal of the algorithm is to stabilize the queues in the system while learning the service rates of servers. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms based on UCB and Thompson Sampling, which achieve system stability with an average queue length bound of $O(\min\\{N,K\\}/\epsilon)$ for a large time horizon $T$, where $\epsilon$ is a traffic slackness of the system. Furthermore, the algorithms achieve sublinear regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\min\\{\sqrt{T}Q_{\max},T^{3/4}\\})$, where $Q_{\max}$ represents the maximum queue length over agents and times.  Lastly, we provide experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.</p>

                        <p><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have yielded unprecedented performances for zero-shot image classification, yet their generalization capability may still be seriously challenged when confronted to domain shifts. In response, we present Weight Average Test-Time Adaptation (WATT) of CLIP, a new approach facilitating full test-time adaptation (TTA) of this VLM. Our method employs a diverse set of templates for text prompts, augmenting the existing framework of CLIP. Predictions are utilized as pseudo labels for model updates, followed by weight averaging to consolidate the learned information globally. Furthermore, we introduce a text ensemble strategy, enhancing the overall test performance by aggregating diverse textual cues.Our findings underscore the effectiveness of WATT across diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10.1, CIFAR-100-C, VisDA-C, and several other challenging datasets, effectively covering a wide range of domain shifts. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the need for additional model transformations or trainable modules. Moreover, compared to other TTA methods, our approach can operate effectively with just a single image. The code is available at: https://github.com/Mehrdad-Noori/WATT.</p>

                        <p>Consider the domain of multiclass classification within the adversarial online setting.  What is the price of relying on bandit feedback as opposed to full information? To what extent can an adaptive adversary amplify the loss compared to an oblivious one? To what extent can a randomized learner reduce the loss compared to a deterministic one? We study these questions in the mistake bound model and provide nearly tight answers.We demonstrate that the optimal mistake bound under bandit feedback is at most $O(k)$ times higher than the optimal mistake bound in the full information case, where $k$ represents the number of labels. This bound is tight and provides an answer to an open question previously posed and studied by Daniely and Helbertal ['13] and by Long ['17, '20], who focused on deterministic learners.Moreover, we present nearly optimal bounds of $\tilde{\Theta}(k)$ on the gap between randomized and deterministic learners, as well as between adaptive and oblivious adversaries in the bandit feedback setting. This stands in contrast to the full information scenario, where adaptive and oblivious adversaries are equivalent, and the gap in mistake bounds between randomized and deterministic learners is a constant multiplicative factor of $2$.In addition, our results imply that in some cases the optimal randomized mistake bound is approximately the square-root of its deterministic parallel. Previous results show that this is essentially the smallest it can get.Some of our results are proved via a reduction to prediction with expert advice under bandit feedback, a problem interesting on its own right. For this problem, we provide a randomized algorithm which is nearly optimal in some scenarios.</p>

                        <p><p>Image generation has shown remarkable results in generating high-fidelity realistic images, in particular with the advancement of diffusion-based models. However, the prevalence of AI-generated images may have side effects for the machine learning community that are not clearly identified. Meanwhile, the success of deep learning in computer vision is driven by the massive dataset collected on the Internet. The extensive quantity of synthetic data being added to the Internet would become an obstacle for future researchers to collect "clean" datasets without AI-generated content. Prior research has shown that using datasets contaminated by synthetic images may result in performance degradation when used for training. In this paper, we investigate the potential impact of contaminated datasets on Online Continual Learning (CL) research. We experimentally show that contaminated datasets might hinder the training of existing online CL methods. Also, we propose Entropy Selection with Real-synthetic similarity Maximization (ESRM), a method to alleviate the performance deterioration caused by synthetic images when training online CL models. Experiments show that our method can significantly alleviate performance deterioration, especially when the contamination is severe.

This provides the first order-optimal barely random algorithms for metrical task systems, i.e. which use a number of random bits that does not depend on the number of requests addressed to the system. We discuss implications on various aspects of online decision making such as: distributed systems, advice complexity and transaction costs, suggesting broad applicability. We put forward an equivalent view that we call collective metrical task systems where $k$ agents in a metrical task system team up, and suffer the average cost paid by each agent. Our results imply that such team can be $O(\log^2 n)$-competitive as soon as $k\geq n^2$. In comparison, a single agent is always $\Omega(n)$-competitive.</p>

                        <p><p>Due to the rapid generation and dissemination of information, large language models (LLMs) quickly run out of date despite enormous development costs. To address the crucial need to keep models updated, online learning has emerged as a critical tool when utilizing LLMs for real-world applications. However, given the ever-expanding corpus of unseen documents and the large parameter space of modern LLMs, efficient adaptation is essential. To address these challenges, we propose \mname, an efficient and effective online adaptation framework for LLMs with strong knowledge retention. We propose a feature extraction and memory-augmentation approach to compress and extract information from new documents into compact modulations stored in a memory bank. When answering questions, our model attends to and extracts relevant knowledge from this memory bank. To learn informative modulations in an efficient manner, we utilize amortization-based meta-learning, which substitutes an otherwise required optimization process with a single forward pass of the encoder. Subsequently, we learn to choose from and aggregate selected documents into a single modulation by conditioning on the question, allowing us to adapt a frozen language model during test time without requiring further gradient updates. Our experiment demonstrates the superiority of \sname in multiple aspects, including online adaptation performance, time, and memory efficiency. In addition, we show how \sname can be combined with and improve the performance of popular alternatives such as retrieval augmented generations (RAGs).

                        <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel variation of multi-armed bandits called bandits with ranking feedback. Unlike traditional bandits, this variation provides feedback to the learner that allows them to rank the arms based on previous pulls, without quantifying numerically the difference in performance.  This type of feedback is well-suited for scenarios where the arms' values cannot be precisely measured using metrics such as monetary scores, probabilities, or occurrences. Common examples include  human preferences in matchmaking problems. Furthermore, its investigation answers the theoretical question on how numerical rewards are crucial in bandit settings. In particular, we study the problem of designing no-regret algorithms with ranking feedback both in the stochastic and adversarial settings. We show that, with stochastic rewards, differently from what happens with non-ranking feedback, no algorithm can suffer a logarithmic regret in the time horizon $T$ in the instance-dependent case. Furthermore, we provide two algorithms. The first, namely DREE, guarantees a superlogarithmic regret in $T$ in the instance-dependent case thus matching our lower bound, while the second, namely R-LPE, guarantees a regret of $\mathcal{\widetilde O}(\sqrt{T})$ in the instance-independent case. Remarkably, we show that no algorithm can have an optimal regret bound in both instance-dependent and instance-independent cases. Finally, we prove that no algorithm can achieve a sublinear regret when the rewards are adversarial.</p>

                        <p>We investigate bandit convex optimization (BCO) with delayed feedback, where only the loss value of the action is revealed under an arbitrary delay. Let $n,T,\bar{d}$ denote the dimensionality, time horizon, and average delay, respectively. Previous studies have achieved an $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+(n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound for this problem, whose delay-independent part matches the regret of the classical non-delayed bandit gradient descent algorithm. However, there is a large gap between its delay-dependent part, i.e., $O((n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, and an existing $\Omega(\sqrt{\bar{d}T})$ lower bound. In this paper, we illustrate that this gap can be filled in the worst case, where $\bar{d}$ is very close to the maximum delay $d$. Specifically, we first develop a novel algorithm, and prove that it enjoys a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+\sqrt{dT})$ in general. Compared with the previous result, our regret bound is better for $d=O((n\bar{d})^{2/3}T^{1/3})$, and the delay-dependent part is tight in the worst case. The primary idea is to decouple the joint effect of the delays and the bandit feedback on the regret by carefully incorporating the delayed bandit feedback with a blocking update mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm can improve the regret bound to $O((nT)^{2/3}\log^{1/3}T+d\log T)$ for strongly convex functions. Finally, if the action sets are unconstrained, we demonstrate that it can be simply extended to achieve an $O(n\sqrt{T\log T}+d\log T)$ regret bound for strongly convex and smooth functions.</p>

                        <p>Approximating invariant subspaces of generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) is a fundamental computational problem at the core of machine learning and scientific computing. It is, for example, the root of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and noise filtering, and of Density Functional Theory (DFT), arguably the most popular method to calculate the electronic structure of materials. Given Hermitian $H,S\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$, where $S$ is positive-definite,  let $\Pi_k$ be the true spectral projector on the invariant subspace that is associated with the $k$ smallest (or largest) eigenvalues of the GEP $HC=SC\Lambda$, for some $k\in[n]$. We show that we can compute a matrix $\widetilde\Pi_k$ such that $\lVert\Pi_k-\widetilde\Pi_k\rVert_2\leq \epsilon$, in $O\left( n^{\omega+\eta}\mathrm{polylog}(n,\epsilon^{-1},\kappa(S),\mathrm{gap}_k^{-1}) \right)$ bit operations in the floating point model, for some $\epsilon\in(0,1)$, with probability $1-1/n$. Here, $\eta>0$ is arbitrarily small, $\omega\lesssim 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent, $\kappa(S)=\lVert S\rVert_2\lVert S^{-1}\rVert_2$, and $\mathrm{gap}_k$ is the gap between eigenvalues $k$ and $k+1$. To achieve such provable "forward-error" guarantees, our methods rely on a new $O(n^{\omega+\eta})$ stability analysis for the Cholesky factorization, and a smoothed analysis for computing spectral gaps, which can be of independent interest.Ultimately, we obtain new matrix multiplication-type bit complexity upper bounds for PCA problems, including classical PCA and (randomized) low-rank approximation.</p>

                        <p><p>We propose a new variant of the Adam optimizer called MicroAdam that specifically minimizes memory overheads, while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. We achieve this by compressing the gradient information before it is fed into the optimizer state, thereby reducing its memory footprint significantly. We control the resulting compression  error via a novel instance of the classical <em>error feedback</em> mechanism from distributed optimization in which <em>the error correction information is itself compressed</em> to allow for practical memory gains. We prove that the resulting approach maintains theoretical convergence guarantees competitive to those of AMSGrad, while providing good practical performance. Specifically, we show that MicroAdam can be implemented efficiently on GPUs: on both million-scale (BERT) and billion-scale (LLaMA) models, MicroAdam provides practical convergence competitive to that of the uncompressed Adam baseline, with  lower memory usage and similar running time.

                        <p><p>Adam has been shown to outperform gradient descent on large language models by a larger margin than on other tasks, but it is unclear why. We show that a key factor in this performance gap is the heavy-tailed class imbalance found in language tasks. When trained with gradient descent, the loss of infrequent words decreases more slowly than the loss of frequent ones. This leads to a slow decrease on the average loss as most samples come from infrequent words. On the other hand, Adam and sign-based methods are less sensitive to this problem. To establish that this behavior is caused by class imbalance, we show empirically that it can be reproduced across architectures and data types, on language transformers, vision CNNs, and linear models. On a linear model with cross-entropy loss, we show that class imbalance leads to imbalanced, correlated gradients and Hessians that have been hypothesized to benefit Adam. We also prove that, in continuous time, gradient descent converges slowly on low-frequency classes while sign descent does not.</p>

                        <p>Gradient descent and its variants are de facto standard algorithms for training machine learning models. As gradient descent is sensitive to its hyperparameters, we need to tune the hyperparameters carefully using a grid search. However, the method is time-consuming, particularly when multiple hyperparameters exist. Therefore, recent studies have analyzed parameter-free methods that adjust the hyperparameters on the fly. However, the existing work is limited to investigations of parameter-free methods for the stepsize, and parameter-free methods for other hyperparameters have not been explored. For instance, although the gradient clipping threshold is a crucial hyperparameter in addition to the stepsize for preventing gradient explosion issues, none of the existing studies have investigated parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Specifically, we propose Inexact Polyak Stepsize, which converges to the optimal solution without any hyperparameters tuning, and its convergence rate is asymptotically independent of $L$ under $L$-smooth and $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth assumptions of the loss function, similar to that of clipped gradient descent with well-tuned hyperparameters. We numerically validated our convergence results using a synthetic function and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods using LSTM, Nano-GPT, and T5.</p>

However, each SAM update requires <em>sequentially</em> computing two gradients, effectively doubling the per-iteration cost compared to base optimizers like SGD. We propose a simple modification of SAM, termed SAMPa, which allows us to fully parallelize the two gradient computations. SAMPa achieves a twofold speedup of SAM under the assumption that communication costs between devices are negligible. Empirical results show that SAMPa ranks among the most efficient variants of SAM in terms of computational time. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms SAM across both vision and language tasks. Notably, SAMPa theoretically maintains convergence guarantees even for  <em>fixed</em> perturbation sizes, which is established through a novel Lyapunov function. We in fact arrive at SAMPa by treating this convergence guarantee as a hard requirement---an approach we believe is promising for developing SAM-based methods in general.

                        <p><p>With the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), the demand for fine-tuning and deploying LLMs in various downstream tasks has garnered widespread interest. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques represented by LoRA and model quantization techniques represented by GPTQ and AWQ are of paramount significance. However, although these techniques have been widely adopted in single-task scenarios, research is scarce in multi-task scenarios. To be specific, we find that mainstream quantization methods would prevent the base LLM from being shared among tasks, so current LLM serving systems are infeasible to integrate LLM quantization with multiple LoRA adapters to achieve memory-efficient multi-task serving. Moreover, existing LLM serving systems lack support for dynamic task addition and overlook the workload differences among tasks, leading to inefficiencies in multi-task scenarios.This work proposes LoRA-Inlaid, an efficient multi-task LLM serving system. On the one hand, LoRA-Inlaid designs a flexible and efficient multi-task quantization algorithm (MLGPTQ) that facilitates the sharing of a single quantized model for multiple LoRA adapters, which significantly reduces the memory consumption for model deployment. Meanwhile, it supports adding LoRA adapters for new tasks on the fly, without sacrificing the stability of online services. On the other hand, LoRA-Inlaid develops a novel multi-task scheduling algorithm guided by output length prediction and grouping among different tasks, which effectively shrinks the memory consumption and avoids frequent switching of LoRA adapters. Empirical results verify that LoRA-Inlaid outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 1.58 times in terms of throughput, 1.76 times in terms of average latency, 2 times in terms of job completion time, and 10 times in terms of SLO Attainment, while maintaining the same level of model quality.</p>

                        <p><p>Multi-agent AI research promises a path to develop human-like and human-compatible intelligent technologies that complement the solipsistic view of other approaches, which mostly do not consider interactions between agents. Aiming to make progress in this direction, the Melting Pot contest 2023 focused on the problem of cooperation among interacting agents and challenged researchers to push the boundaries of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for mixed-motive games. The contest leveraged the Melting Pot environment suite to rigorously evaluate how well agents can adapt their cooperative skills to interact with novel partners in unforeseen situations. Unlike other reinforcement learning challenges, this challenge focused on   \textit{social} rather than \textit{environmental} generalisation. In particular, a population of agents performs well in Melting Pot when its component individuals are adept at finding ways to cooperate both with others in their population and with strangers. Thus Melting Pot measures \emph{cooperative intelligence}.The contest attracted over 600 participants across 100+ teams globally and was a success on multiple fronts: (i) it contributed to our goal of pushing the frontiers of MARL towards building more cooperatively intelligent agents, evidenced by several submissions that outperformed established baselines; (ii) it attracted a diverse range of participants, from independent researchers to industry affiliates and academic labs, both with strong background and new interest in the area alike, broadening the field’s demographic and intellectual diversity; and (iii) analyzing the submitted agents provided important insights, highlighting areas for improvement in evaluating agents' cooperative intelligence. This paper summarizes the design aspects and results of the contest and explores the potential of Melting Pot as a benchmark for studying Cooperative AI. We further analyze the top solutions and conclude with a discussion on promising directions for future research.</p>

                        <p>Scalarization is a general, parallizable technique that can be deployed in any multiobjective setting to reduce multiple objectives into one, yet some have dismissed this versatile approach because linear scalarizations cannot explore concave regions of the Pareto frontier. To that end, we aim to find simple non-linear scalarizations that provably explore a diverse set of $k$ objectives on the Pareto frontier, as measured by the dominated hypervolume. We show that hypervolume scalarizations with uniformly random weights achieves an optimal sublinear hypervolume regret bound of $O(T^{-1/k})$, with matching lower bounds that preclude any algorithm from doing better asymptotically. For the setting of multiobjective stochastic linear bandits, we utilize properties of hypervolume scalarizations to derive a novel non-Euclidean analysis to get regret bounds of $\tilde{O}( d T^{-1/2} + T^{-1/k})$, removing unnecessary $\text{poly}(k)$ dependencies. We support our theory with strong empirical performance of using non-linear scalarizations that outperforms both their linear counterparts and other standard multiobjective algorithms in a variety of natural settings.</p>

                        <p>Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is an indispensable post-processing step in object detection. With the continuous optimization of network models, NMS has become the ``last mile'' to enhance the efficiency of object detection. This paper systematically analyzes NMS from a graph theory perspective for the first time, revealing its intrinsic structure. Consequently, we propose two optimization methods, namely QSI-NMS and BOE-NMS. The former is a fast recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm with negligible mAP loss, and its extended version (eQSI-NMS) achieves optimal complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$. The latter, concentrating on the locality of NMS, achieves an optimization at a constant level without an mAP loss penalty. Moreover, to facilitate rapid evaluation of NMS methods for researchers, we introduce NMS-Bench, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively assess various NMS methods. Taking the YOLOv8-N model on MS COCO 2017 as the benchmark setup, our method QSI-NMS provides $6.2\times$ speed of original NMS on the benchmark, with a $0.1\%$ decrease in mAP. The optimal eQSI-NMS, with only a $0.3\%$ mAP decrease, achieves $10.7\times$ speed. Meanwhile, BOE-NMS exhibits $5.1\times$ speed with no compromise in mAP.</p>

                        <p>To address the uncertainty in function types, recent progress in online convex optimization (OCO) has spurred the development of universal algorithms that simultaneously attain minimax rates for multiple types of convex functions. However, for a $T$-round online problem, state-of-the-art methods typically conduct $O(\log T)$ projections onto the domain in each round, a process potentially time-consuming with complicated feasible sets. In this paper, inspired by the black-box reduction of Cutkosky and Orabona [2018], we employ a surrogate loss defined over simpler domains to develop universal OCO algorithms that only require $1$ projection. Embracing the framework of prediction with expert advice, we maintain a set of experts for each type of functions and aggregate their predictions via a meta-algorithm. The crux of our approach lies in a uniquely designed expert-loss for strongly convex functions, stemming from an innovative decomposition of the regret into the meta-regret and the expert-regret. Our analysis sheds new light on the surrogate loss, facilitating a rigorous examination of the discrepancy between the regret of the original loss and that of the surrogate loss, and carefully controlling meta-regret under the strong convexity condition. With only $1$ projection per round, we establish optimal regret bounds for general convex, exponentially concave, and strongly convex functions simultaneously. Furthermore, we enhance the expert-loss to exploit the smoothness property, and demonstrate that our algorithm can attain small-loss regret for multiple types of convex and smooth functions.</p>

                        <p>Stochastic second-order methods are known to achieve fast local convergence in strongly convex optimization by relying on noisy Hessian estimates to precondition the gradient. Yet, most of these methods achieve superlinear convergence only when the stochastic Hessian noise diminishes, requiring an increase in the per-iteration cost as time progresses. Recent work in \cite{na2022hessian} addressed this issue via a Hessian averaging scheme that achieves a superlinear convergence rate without increasing the per-iteration cost. However, the considered method exhibits a slow global convergence rate, requiring up to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^2)$ iterations to reach the superlinear rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((1/t)^{t/2})$, where $\kappa$ is the problem's condition number. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic Newton proximal extragradient method that significantly improves these bounds, achieving a faster global linear rate and reaching the same fast superlinear rate in  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ iterations. We achieve this by developing a novel extension of the Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (HPE) framework, which simultaneously achieves fast global and local convergence rates for strongly convex functions with access to a noisy Hessian oracle.</p>

                        <p><p>Exploiting the power of pre-trained models, prompt-based approaches stand out compared to other continual learning solutions in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting, even with very few learnable parameters and without the need for a memory buffer. While existing prompt-based continual learning methods excel in leveraging prompts for state-of-the-art performance, they often lack a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of prompting. This paper conducts a theoretical analysis to unravel how prompts bestow such advantages in continual learning, thus offering a new perspective on prompt design. We first show that the attention block of pre-trained models like Vision Transformers inherently encodes a special mixture of experts architecture, characterized by linear experts and quadratic gating score functions. This realization drives us to provide a novel view on prefix tuning, reframing it as the addition of new task-specific experts, thereby inspiring the design of a novel gating mechanism termed Non-linear Residual Gates (NoRGa). Through the incorporation of non-linear activation and residual connection, NoRGa enhances continual learning performance while preserving parameter efficiency. The effectiveness of NoRGa is substantiated both theoretically and empirically across diverse benchmarks and pretraining paradigms.</p>

                        <p><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train.Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix.We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks.Our approach goes beyond the popular KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights which allows us to apply a variant of KFAC for networks with weight-sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods.</p>

                        <p>Optimal Transport (OT) based distances are powerful tools for machine learning to compare probability measures and manipulate them using OT maps. In this field, a setting of interest is semi-discrete OT, where the source measure $\mu$ is continuous, while the target $\nu$ is discrete. Recent works have shown that the minimax rate for the OT map is $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$ when using $t$ i.i.d. subsamples from each measure (two-sample setting). An open question is whether a better convergence rate can be achieved when the full information of the discrete measure $\nu$ is known (one-sample setting). In this work, we     answer positively to this question by (i) proving an $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ lower bound rate for the OT map, using the similarity between Laguerre cells estimation and density support estimation, and (ii) proposing a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with adaptive entropic regularization and averaging acceleration. To nearly achieve the desired fast rate, characteristic of non-regular parametric problems, we design an entropic regularization scheme decreasing with the number of samples.     Another key step in our algorithm consists of using a projection step that permits to leverage the local strong convexity of the regularized OT problem. Our convergence analysis integrates online convex optimization and stochastic gradient techniques, complemented by the specificities of the OT semi-dual. Moreover, while being as computationally and memory efficient as vanilla SGD, our algorithm achieves the unusual fast rates of our theory in numerical experiments.</p>

                        <p><p>Bilevel Optimization has experienced significant advancements recently with the introduction of new efficient algorithms. Mirroring the success in single-level optimization, stochastic gradient-based algorithms are widely used in bilevel optimization. However, a common limitation in these algorithms is the presumption of independent sampling, which can lead to increased computational costs due to the unique hyper-gradient structure in bilevel problems. To address this challenge, we study the example-selection strategy for bilevel optimization in this work. More specifically, we introduce a without-replacement sampling based algorithm which achieves a faster convergence rate compared to its counterparts that rely on independent sampling. Beyond the standard bilevel optimization formulation, we extend our discussion to conditional bilevel optimization and also two special cases: minimax and compositional optimization. Finally, we validate our algorithms over both synthetic and real-world applications. Numerical results clearly showcase the superiority of our algorithms.</p>

                        <p><p>Computational optimal transport (OT) has received massive interests in the machine learning community, and great advances have been gained in the direction of entropic-regularized OT. The Sinkhorn algorithm, as well as its many improved versions, has become the <em>de facto</em> solution to large-scale OT problems. However, most of the existing methods behave like first-order methods, which typically require a large number of iterations to converge. More recently, Newton-type methods using sparsified Hessian matrices have demonstrated promising results on OT computation, but there still remain a lot of unresolved open questions. In this article, we make major new progresses towards this direction: first, we propose a novel Hessian sparsification scheme that promises a strict control of the approximation error; second, based on this sparsification scheme, we develop a <em>safe</em> Newton-type method that is guaranteed to avoid singularity in computing the search directions; third, the developed algorithm has a clear implementation for practical use, avoiding most hyperparameter tuning; and remarkably, we provide rigorous global and local convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, which is lacking in the prior literature. Various numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving large-scale OT problems.</p>

                        <p>Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALMs) are widely employed in solving constrained optimizations, and some efficient solvers are developed based on this framework. Under the quadratic growth assumption, it is known that the dual iterates and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) residuals of ALMs applied to conic programs converge linearly. In contrast, the convergence rate of the primal iterates has remained elusive. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by establishing new $\textit{quadratic growth}$ and $\textit{error bound}$ properties for primal and dual conic programs under the standard strict complementarity condition. Our main results reveal that both primal and dual iterates of the ALMs converge linearly contingent solely upon the assumption of strict complementarity and a bounded solution set. This finding provides a positive answer to an open question regarding the asymptotically linear convergence of the primal iterates of ALMs applied to conic optimization.</p>

                        <p>We develop new sub-optimality bounds for gradient descent (GD) that depend on the conditioning of the objective along the path of optimization, rather than on global, worst-case constants.  Key to our proofs is directional smoothness, a measure of gradient variation that we use to develop upper-bounds on the objective.  Minimizing these upper-bounds requires solving implicit equations to obtain a sequence of strongly adapted step-sizes; we show that these equations are straightforward to solve for convex quadratics and lead to new guarantees for two classical step-sizes.  For general functions, we prove that the Polyak step-size and normalized GD obtain fast, path-dependent rates despite using no knowledge of the directional smoothness.  Experiments on logistic regression show our convergence guarantees are tighter than the classical theory based on $L$-smoothness.</p>

This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs), an emerging variant of Hyper-Heuristics that leverages LLMs for heuristic generation, featuring minimal manual intervention and open-ended heuristic spaces. To empower LHHs, we present Reflective Evolution (ReEvo), a novel integration of evolutionary search for efficiently exploring the heuristic space, and LLM reflections to provide verbal gradients within the space. Across five heterogeneous algorithmic types, six different COPs, and both white-box and black-box views of COPs, ReEvo yields state-of-the-art and competitive meta-heuristics, evolutionary algorithms, heuristics, and neural solvers, while being more sample-efficient than prior LHHs.</p>

                        <p><p>The branch-and-cut algorithm is the method of choice to solve large scale integer programming problems in practice. A key ingredient of branch-and-cut is the use of <em>cutting planes</em> which are derived constraints that reduce the search space for an optimal solution. Selecting effective cutting planes to produce small branch-and-cut trees is a critical challenge in the branch-and-cut algorithm. Recent advances have employed a data-driven approach to select good cutting planes from a parameterized family, aimed at reducing the branch-and-bound tree size (in expectation) for a given distribution of integer programming instances. We extend this idea to the selection of the best cut generating function (CGF), which is a tool in the integer programming literature for generating a wide variety of cutting planes that generalize the well-known Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cutting planes. We provide rigorous sample complexity bounds for the selection of an effective CGF from certain parameterized families that provably performs well for any specified distribution on the problem instances. Our empirical results show that the selected CGF can outperform the GMI cuts for certain distributions. Additionally, we explore the sample complexity of using neural networks for instance-dependent CGF selection.</p>

                        <p>For constrained, not necessarily monotone submodular maximization, all known approximation algorithms with ratio greater than $1/e$ require continuous ideas, such as queries to the multilinear extension of a submodular function and its gradient, which are typically expensive to simulate with the original set function. For combinatorial algorithms, the best known approximation ratios for both size and matroid constraint are obtained by a simple randomized greedy algorithm of Buchbinder et al. [9]: $1/e \approx 0.367$ for size constraint and $0.281$ for the matroid constraint in $\mathcal O (kn)$ queries, where $k$ is the rank of the matroid. In this work, we develop the first combinatorial algorithms to break the $1/e$ barrier: we obtain approximation ratio of $0.385$ in $\mathcal O (kn)$ queries to the submodular set function for size constraint, and $0.305$ for a general matroid constraint. These are achieved by guiding the randomized greedy algorithm with a fast local search algorithm. Further, we develop deterministic versions of these algorithms, maintaining the same ratio and asymptotic time complexity. Finally, we develop a deterministic, nearly linear time algorithm with ratio $0.377$.</p>

Constrained bilevel problems with integer variables are particularly notorious for their hardness. While exact solvers have been proposed for mixed-integer <em>linear</em> bilevel optimization, they tend to scale poorly with problem size and are hard to generalize to the non-linear case. On the other hand, problem-specific algorithms (exact and heuristic) are limited in scope. Under a data-driven setting in which similar instances of a bilevel problem are solved routinely, our proposed framework, Neur2BiLO, embeds a neural network approximation of the leader's or follower's value function, trained via supervised regression, into an easy-to-solve mixed-integer program.  Neur2BiLO serves as a heuristic that produces high-quality solutions extremely fast for four applications with linear and non-linear objectives and pure and mixed-integer variables.</p>

                        <p><p>This work proposes a self-supervised training strategy designed for combinatorial problems. An obstacle in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the need for costly target solutions often produced with exact solvers. Inspired by semi- and self-supervised learning, we show that generative models can be trained by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, eliminating the need for optimality information. We validate this Self-Labeling Improvement Method (SLIM) on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the neural combinatorial community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with SLIM. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and state-of-the-art learning proposals for the JSP. Lastly, we prove the robustness of SLIM to various parameters and its generality by applying it to the Traveling Salesman Problem.</p>

                        <p><p>First-order optimization (FOO) algorithms are pivotal in numerous computational domains, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning. However, their application to complex tasks often entails significant optimization inefficiency due to their need of many sequential iterations for convergence. In response, we introduce first-order optimization expedited with approximately parallelized iterations (OptEx), the first general framework that enhances the time efficiency of FOO by leveraging parallel computing to directly mitigate its requirement of many sequential iterations for convergence. To achieve this, OptEx utilizes a kernelized gradient estimation that is based on the history of evaluated gradients to predict the gradients required by the next few sequential iterations in FOO, which helps to break the inherent iterative dependency and hence enables the approximate parallelization of iterations in FOO. We further establish theoretical guarantees for the estimation error of our kernelized gradient estimation and the iteration complexity of SGD-based OptEx, confirming that the estimation error diminishes to zero as the history of gradients accumulates and that our SGD-based OptEx enjoys an effective acceleration rate of Θ(√N ) over standard SGD given parallelism of N, in terms of the sequential iterations required for convergence. Finally, we provide extensive empirical studies, including synthetic functions, reinforcement learning tasks, and neural network training on various datasets, to underscore the substantial efficiency improvements achieved by our OptEx in practice.</p>

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MARINA-P with permutation compressors can achieve a server-to-worker communication complexity improving with the number of workers, thus being provably superior to existing algorithms. We further show that MARINA-P can serve as a starting point for extensions such as methods supporting bidirectional compression: we introduce M3, a method combining MARINA-P with uplink compression and a momentum step, achieving bidirectional compression with provable improvements in total communication complexity as the number of workers increases.

                        <p><p>Pipeline parallelism has been widely explored, but most existing schedules lack a systematic methodology. In this paper, we propose a framework to decompose pipeline schedules as repeating a building block, and show that the lifespan of the building block decides the peak activation memory of the pipeline schedule. Guided by the observations, we find that almost all existing pipeline schedules, to the best of our knowledge, are memory inefficient. To address this, we introduce a family of memory efficient building blocks with controllable activation memory, which can reduce the peak activation memory to 1/2 of 1F1B without sacrificing efficiency, and even to 1/3 with comparable throughput. We can also achieve almost zero pipeline bubbles while maintaining the same activation memory as 1F1B. Our evaluations demonstrate that in pure pipeline parallelism settings, our methods outperform 1F1B by from 7\% to 55\% in terms of throughput. When employing a grid search over hybrid parallelism hyperparameters in practical scenarios, our methods demonstrate a 16\% throughput improvement over the 1F1B baseline for large language models.

                        <p><p>Despite advances using low-rank adapters and quantization, pretraining of large models on consumer hardware has not been possible without model sharding, offloading during training, or per-layer gradient updates. To address these limitations, we propose Low-Rank Adapters for Quantized Training (LoQT), a method for efficiently training quantized models. LoQT uses gradient-based tensor factorization to initialize low-rank trainable weight matrices that are periodically merged into quantized full-rank weight matrices. Our approach is suitable for both pretraining and fine-tuning models. We demonstrate this for language modeling and downstream task adaptation, finding that LoQT enables efficient training of models up to 7B parameters on a 24GB GPU. We also demonstrate the feasibility of training a 13B model using per-layer gradient updates on the same hardware.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper addresses the minimization of the sum of strongly convex, smoothfunctions over a network of agents without a centralized server. Existing decentralized algorithms require knowledge of functions and network parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant of the global gradient and/or network connectivity, forhyperparameter tuning. Agents usually cannot access this information, leadingto conservative selections and slow convergence or divergence. This paper introduces a decentralized algorithm that eliminates the need for specific parametertuning. Our approach employs an operator splitting technique with a novel variablemetric, enabling a local backtracking line-search to adaptively select the stepsizewithout global information or extensive communications. This results in favorableconvergence guarantees and dependence on optimization and network parameterscompared to existing nonadaptive methods. Notably, our method is the first adaptive decentralized algorithm that achieves linear convergence for strongly convex,smooth objectives. Preliminary numerical experiments support our theoreticalfindings, demonstrating superior performance in convergence speed and scalability.</p>

                        <p>Addressing intermittent client availability is critical for the real-world deployment of federated learning algorithms. Most prior work either overlooks the potential non-stationarity in the dynamics of client unavailability or requires substantial memory/computation overhead. We study federated learning in the presence of heterogeneous and non-stationary client availability, which may occur when the deployment environments are uncertain, or the clients are mobile. The impacts of heterogeneity and non-stationarity on client unavailability can be significant, as we illustrate using FedAvg, the most widely adopted federated learning algorithm. We propose FedAWE, which includes novel algorithmic structures that (i) compensate for missed computations due to unavailability with only $O(1)$ additional memory and computation with respect to standard FedAvg, and (ii) evenly diffuse local updates within the federated learning system through implicit gossiping, despite being agnostic to non-stationary dynamics. We show that FedAWE converges to a stationary point of even non-convex objectives while achieving the desired linear speedup property. We corroborate our analysis with numerical experiments over diversified client unavailability dynamics on real-world data sets.</p>

                        <p><p>Most of existing federated learning (FL) formulation is treated as a point-estimate of models, inherently prone to overfitting on scarce client-side data with overconfident decisions. Though Bayesian inference can alleviate this issue, a direct posterior inference at clients may result in biased local posterior estimates due to data heterogeneity, leading to a sub-optimal global posterior. From an information-theoretic perspective, we propose FedMDMI, a federated posterior inference framework based on model-data mutual information (MI). Specifically, a global model-data MI term is introduced as regularization to enforce the global model to learn essential information from the heterogeneous local data, alleviating the bias caused by data heterogeneity and hence enhancing generalization. To make this global MI tractable, we decompose it into local MI terms at the clients, converting the global objective with MI regularization into several locally optimizable objectives based on local data. For these local objectives, we further show that the optimal local posterior is a Gibbs posterior, which can be efficiently sampled with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics methods. Finally, at the server, we approximate sampling from the global Gibbs posterior by simply averaging samples from the local posteriors. Theoretical analysis provides a generalization bound for FL w.r.t. the model-data MI, which, at different levels of regularization, represents a federated version of the bias-variance trade-off. Experimental results demonstrate a better generalization behavior with better calibrated uncertainty estimates of FedMDMI.</p>

We also propose a guideline for choosing different DP strategies based on simple quantitative calculations, which yields minimal ranking errors.Our experiments demonstrate that PaRO improves the training speed of LLMs by up to 266\% that of ZeRO-3 as basic DP strategies.Moreover, employing PaRO-CC independently for model parallel strategies, such as Megatron, can also boost the training speed by 17\%.</p>

                        <p><p>Diffusion models have recently advanced Combinatorial Optimization (CO) as a powerful backbone for neural solvers. However, their iterative sampling process requiring denoising across multiple noise levels incurs substantial overhead. We propose to learn direct mappings from different noise levels to the optimal solution for a given instance, facilitating high-quality generation with minimal shots. This is achieved through an optimization consistency training protocol, which, for a given instance, minimizes the difference among samples originating from varying generative trajectories and time steps relative to the optimal solution. The proposed model enables fast single-step solution generation while retaining the option of multi-step sampling to trade for sampling quality, which offers a more effective and efficient alternative backbone for neural solvers. In addition, within the training-to-testing (T2T) framework, to bridge the gap between training on historical instances and solving new instances, we introduce a novel consistency-based gradient search scheme during the test stage, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space learned during training. It is achieved by updating the latent solution probabilities under objective gradient guidance during the alternation of noise injection and denoising steps. We refer to this model as Fast T2T. Extensive experiments on two popular tasks, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS), demonstrate the superiority of Fast T2T regarding both solution quality and efficiency, even outperforming LKH given limited time budgets. Notably, Fast T2T with merely one-step generation and one-step gradient search can mostly outperform the SOTA diffusion-based counterparts that require hundreds of steps, while achieving tens of times speedup.</p>

                        <p><p>Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</p>

                        <p>Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning.

                        <p>Embeddings play a pivotal role across various disciplines, offering compact representations of complex data structures. Randomized methods like Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) provide state-of-the-art and essentially unimprovable theoretical guarantees for achieving such representations. These guarantees are worst-case and in particular, neither the analysis, ${\textit{nor the algorithm}}$, takes into account any potential structural information of the data. The natural question is: must we randomize? Could we instead use an optimization-based approach, working directly with the data? A first answer is no: as we show, the distance-preserving objective of JL has a non-convex landscape over the space of projection matrices, with many bad stationary points. But this is not the final answer. We present a novel method motivated by diffusion models, that circumvents this fundamental challenge: rather than performing optimization directly over the space of projection matrices, we use optimization over the larger space of $\textit{random solution samplers}$, gradually reducing the variance of the sampler. We show that by moving through this larger space, our objective converges to a deterministic (zero variance) solution, avoiding bad stationary points. This method can also be seen as an optimization-based derandomization approach, and is an idea and method that we believe can be applied to many other problems.</p>

Such tasks are commonly encountered in protein design, robotics, and clinical medicine where evaluating the oracle function is prohibitively expensive. However, inaccurate surrogate model predictions are frequently encountered along offline optimization trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose <em>generative adversarial model-based optimization</em> using <strong>adaptive source critic regularization (aSCR)</strong>—a task- and optimizer- agnostic framework for constraining the optimization trajectory to regions of the design space where the surrogate function is reliable. We propose a computationally tractable algorithm to dynamically adjust the strength of this constraint, and show how leveraging aSCR with standard Bayesian optimization outperforms existing methods on a suite of offline generative design tasks.

The predictions for these components, typically generated by "black-box" machine learning tools, are prone to inaccuracies. To tackle this challenge, we introduce DISC, a novel policy that learns a confidence parameter online to harness the potential of accurate predictions while also mitigating the impact of erroneous forecasts. When predictions are precise, DISC leverages this information to achieve near-optimal performance. Conversely, in the case of significant prediction errors, it still has a worst-case competitive ratio guarantee. We provide competitive ratio bounds for DISC under both linear mixing of latent variables as well as a broader class of mixing functions. Our results highlight a first-of-its-kind "best-of-both-worlds" integration of machine-learned predictions, thus lead to a near-optimal consistency and robustness tradeoff, which provably improves what can be obtained without learning the confidence parameter. We validate the applicability of DISC across a spectrum of practical scenarios.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper studies a risk minimization problem with decision dependent data distribution. The problem pertains to the performative prediction setting in which a trained model can affect the outcome estimated by the model. Such dependency creates a feedback loop that influences the stability of optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present the first study on performative prediction with smooth but possibly non-convex loss. We analyze a greedy deployment scheme with SGD (SGD-GD). Note that in the literature, SGD-GD is often studied with strongly convex loss. We first propose the definition of stationary performative stable (SPS) solutions through relaxing the popular performative stable condition. We then prove that SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution in expectation. We consider two conditions of sensitivity on the distribution shifts: (i) the sensitivity is characterized by Wasserstein-1 distance and the loss is Lipschitz w.r.t. data samples, or (ii) the sensitivity is characterized by total variation (TV) divergence and the loss is bounded. In both conditions, the bias levels are proportional to the stochastic gradient's variance and sensitivity level. Our analysis is extended to a lazy deployment scheme where models are deployed once per several SGD updates, and we show that it converges to a bias-free SPS solution. Numerical experiments corroborate our theories.</p>

                        <p><p>Contextual linear optimization (CLO) uses predictive contextual features to reduce uncertainty in random cost coefficients and thereby improve average-cost performance. An example is the stochastic shortest path problem with random edge costs (e.g., traffic) and contextual features (e.g., lagged traffic, weather). Existing work on CLO assumes the data has fully observed cost coefficient vectors, but in many applications, we can only see the realized cost of a historical decision, that is, just one projection of the random cost coefficient vector, to which we refer as bandit feedback. We study a class of offline learning algorithms for CLO with bandit feedback, which we term induced empirical risk minimization (IERM), where we fit a predictive model to directly optimize the downstream performance of the policy it induces. We show a fast-rate regret bound for IERM that allows for misspecified model classes and flexible choices of the optimization estimate, and we develop computationally tractable surrogate losses. A byproduct of our theory of independent interest is fast-rate regret bound for IERM with full feedback and misspecified policy class. We compare the performance of different modeling choices numerically using a stochastic shortest path example and provide practical insights from the empirical results.</p>

                        <p>Many zeroth-order (ZO) optimization algorithms have been developed to solve nonconvex minimax problems in machine learning and computer vision areas. However, existing ZO minimax algorithms have high complexity and rely on some strict restrictive conditions for ZO estimations. To address these issues, we design a new unified ZO gradient descent extragradient ascent (ZO-GDEGA) algorithm, which reduces the overall complexity to $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-6})$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the function $\psi$ for nonconvex-concave (NC-C) problems, where $d$ is the variable dimension. To the best of our knowledge, ZO-GDEGA is the first ZO algorithm with complexity guarantees to solve stochastic NC-C problems. Moreover, ZO-GDEGA requires weaker conditions on the ZO estimations and achieves more robust theoretical results. As a by-product, ZO-GDEGA has advantages on the condition number for the NC-strongly concave case. Experimentally, ZO-GDEGA can generate more effective poisoning attack data with an average accuracy reduction of 5\%. The improved AUC performance also verifies the robustness of gradient estimations.</p>

                        <p>Boosting is a highly successful ML-born optimization setting in which one is required to computationally efficiently learn arbitrarily good models based on the access to a weak learner oracle, providing classifiers performing at least slightly differently from random guessing. A key difference with gradient-based optimization is that boosting's original model does not requires access to first order information about a loss, yet the decades long history of boosting has quickly evolved it into a first order optimization setting -- sometimes even wrongfully *defining* it as such. Owing to recent progress extending gradient-based optimization to use only a loss' zeroth ($0^{th}$) order information to learn, this begs the question: what loss functions be efficiently optimized with boosting and what is the information really needed for boosting to meet the *original* boosting blueprint's requirements ?We provide a constructive formal answer essentially showing that *any* loss function can be optimized with boosting and thus boosting can achieve a feat not yet known to be possible in the classical $0^{th}$ order setting, since loss functions are not required to be be convex, nor differentiable or Lipschitz -- and in fact not required to be continuous either. Some tools we use are rooted in quantum calculus, the mathematical field -- not to be confounded with quantum computation -- that studies calculus without passing to the limit, and thus without using first order information.</p>

                        <p><p>Offline optimization has recently emerged as an increasingly popular approach to mitigate the prohibitively expensive cost of online experimentation. The key idea is to learn a surrogate of the black-box function that underlines the target experiment using a static (offline) dataset of its previous input-output queries. Such an approach is, however, fraught with an out-of-distribution issue where the learned surrogate becomes inaccurate outside the offline data regimes. To mitigate this, existing offline optimizers have proposed numerous conditioning techniques to prevent the learned surrogate from being too erratic. Nonetheless, such conditioning strategies are often specific to particular surrogate or search models, which might not generalize to a different model choice. This motivates us to develop a model-agnostic approach instead, which incorporates a notion of model sharpness into the training loss of the surrogate as a regularizer. Our approach is supported by a new theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing surrogate sharpness on the offline dataset provably reduces its generalized sharpness on unseen data. Our analysis extends existing theories from bounding generalized prediction loss (on unseen data) with loss sharpness to bounding the worst-case generalized surrogate sharpness with its empirical estimate on training data, providing a new perspective on sharpness regularization. Our extensive experimentation on a diverse range of optimization tasks also shows that reducing surrogate sharpness often leads to significant improvement, marking (up to) a noticeable 9.6% performance boost.

                        <p><p>``Distribution shift'' is the primary obstacle to the success of offline reinforcement learning. As a learning policy may take actions beyond the knowledge of the behavior policy (referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) actions), the Q-values of these OOD actions can be easily overestimated. Consequently, the learning policy becomes biasedly optimized using the incorrect recovered Q-value function. One commonly used idea to avoid the overestimation of Q-value is to make a pessimistic adjustment. Our key idea is to penalize the Q-values of OOD actions that correspond to high uncertainty. In this work, we propose Q-Distribution guided Q-learning (QDQ) which  pessimistic Q-value on OOD regions based on uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty measure is based on the conditional Q-value distribution, which is learned via a high-fidelity and efficient consistency model. On the other hand, to avoid the overly conservative problem, we introduce an uncertainty-aware optimization objective to update the Q-value function. The proposed QDQ demonstrates solid theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of Q-value distribution learning and uncertainty measurement, as well as the performance of the learning policy. QDQ consistently exhibits strong performance in the D4RL benchmark and shows significant improvements for many tasks. Our code can be found at <code link>.</p>

                        <p>Federated learning is a framework for collaborative machine learning where clients only share gradient updates and not their private data with a server. However, it was recently shown that gradient inversion attacks can reconstruct this data from the shared gradients. In the important honest-but-curious setting, existing attacks enable exact reconstruction only for batch size of $b=1$, with larger batches permitting only approximate reconstruction. In this work, we propose SPEAR, *the first algorithm reconstructing whole batches with $b >1$ exactly*. SPEAR combines insights into the explicit low-rank structure of gradients with a sampling-based algorithm. Crucially, we leverage ReLU-induced gradient sparsity to precisely filter out large numbers of incorrect samples, making a final reconstruction step tractable. We provide an efficient GPU implementation for fully connected networks and show that it recovers high-dimensional ImageNet inputs in batches of up to $b \lesssim 25$ exactly while scaling to large networks. Finally, we show theoretically that much larger batches can be reconstructed with high probability given exponential time.</p>

                        <p>We study the limits and capability of public-data  assisted differentially private (PA-DP) algorithms. Specifically, we focus on the problem of stochastic convex optimization (SCO) with either labeled or unlabeled public data. For complete/labeled public data, we show that any $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PA-DP has excess risk $\tilde{\Omega}\big(\min(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n_{\text{pub}}}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon} ) \big)$, where $d$ is the dimension, ${n_{\text{pub}}}$ is the number of public samples, ${n_{\text{priv}}}$ is the number of private samples, and $n={n_{\text{pub}}}+{n_{\text{priv}}}$. These lower bounds are established via our new lower bounds for PA-DP mean estimation, which are of a similar form. Up to constant factors, these lower bounds show that the simple strategy of either treating all data as private or discarding the private data, is optimal. We also study PA-DP supervised learning with \textit{unlabeled} public samples. In contrast to our previous result, we here show novel methods for leveraging public data in private supervised learning. For generalized linear models (GLM) with unlabeled public data, we show an efficient algorithm which, given $\tilde{O}({n_{\text{priv}}}\epsilon)$ unlabeled public samples, achieves the dimension independent rate $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{{n_{\text{priv}}}}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{{n_{\text{priv}}}\epsilon}}\big)$. We develop new lower bounds for this setting which shows that this rate cannot be improved with more public samples, and any fewer public samples leads to a worse rate. Finally, we provide extensions of this result to general hypothesis classes with finite \textit{fat-shattering dimension} with applications to neural networks and non-Euclidean geometries.</p>

                        <p><p>Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. The standard practice is to select the noise scale to satisfy a given privacy budget ε. This privacy budget is in turn interpreted in terms of operational attack risks, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of inference attacks aimed to recoverinformation about the training data records. We show that first calibrating the noise scale to a privacy budget ε, and then translating ε to attack risk leads to overly conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. Instead, we propose methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing the step of choosing ε. For a given notion of attack risk, our approach significantlydecreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather than ε, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model accuracy for the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy.</p>

                        <p>``The right to be forgotten'' ensured by laws for user data privacy becomes increasingly important. Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the effect of certain data points on the trained model parameters so that it can be approximately the same as if one retrains the model from scratch. We propose to leverage projected noisy stochastic gradient descent for unlearning and establish its first approximate unlearning guarantee under the convexity assumption. Our approach exhibits several benefits, including provable complexity saving compared to retraining, and supporting sequential and batch unlearning. Both of these benefits are closely related to our new results on the infinite Wasserstein distance tracking of the adjacent (un)learning processes. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves a similar utility under the same privacy constraint while using $2\%$ and $10\%$ of the gradient computations compared with the state-of-the-art gradient-based approximate unlearning methods for mini-batch and full-batch settings, respectively.</p>

Their algorithm has a time and space complexity of $\tilde{O}(dk)$.

                        <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their diverse applications. However, the scarcity and quality limitations of graph data present challenges to their training process in practical settings. To facilitate the development of effective GNNs, companies and researchers often seek external collaboration. Yet, directly sharing data raises privacy concerns, motivating data owners to train GNNs on their private graphs and share the trained models. Unfortunately, these models may still inadvertently disclose sensitive properties of their training graphs (\textit{e.g.}, average default rate in a transaction network), leading to severe consequences for data owners. In this work, we study graph property inference attack to identify the risk of sensitive property information leakage from shared models.Existing approaches typically train numerous shadow models for developing such attack, which is computationally intensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose an efficient graph property inference attack by leveraging model approximation techniques. Our method only requires training a small set of models on graphs, while generating a sufficient number of approximated shadow models for attacks.To enhance diversity while reducing errors in the approximated models, we apply edit distance to quantify the diversity within a group of approximated models and introduce a theoretically guaranteed criterion to evaluate each model's error. Subsequently, we propose a novel selection mechanism to ensure that the retained approximated models achieve high diversity and low error.Extensive experiments across six real-world scenarios demonstrate our method's substantial improvement, with average increases of 2.7\% in attack accuracy and 4.1\% in ROC-AUC, while being 6.5$\times$ faster compared to the best baseline.</p>

                        <p><p>Current state-of-the-art methods for differentially private model training are based on matrix factorization techniques. However, these methods suffer from high computational overhead because they require numerically solving a demanding optimization problem to determine an approximately optimal factorization prior to the actual model training. In this work, we present a new matrix factorization approach, BSR, which overcomes this computational bottleneck. By exploiting properties of the standard matrix square root, BSR allows to efficiently handle also large-scale problems. For the key scenario of stochastic gradient descent with momentum and weight decay, we even derive analytical expressions for BSR that render the computational overhead negligible. We prove bounds on the approximation quality that hold both in the centralized and in the federated learning setting. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that models trained using BSR perform on par with the best existing methods, while completely avoiding their computational overhead.</p>

                        <p>As one of the most fundamental non-convex learning problems, ReLU regression under differential privacy (DP) constraints, especially in high-dimensional settings, remains a challenging area in privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing results are limited to the assumptions of bounded norm $ \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq 1$, which becomes meaningless with increasing data dimensionality. In this work, we revisit the problem of DP ReLU regression in high-dimensional regimes. We propose two innovative algorithms DP-GLMtron and DP-TAGLMtron that outperform the conventional DPSGD. DP-GLMtron is based on a generalized linear model perceptron approach, integrating adaptive clipping and Gaussian mechanism for enhanced privacy. To overcome the constraints of small privacy budgets in DP-GLMtron, represented by $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{1/N})$ where $N$ is the sample size, we introduce DP-TAGLMtron, which utilizes a tree aggregation protocol to balance privacy and utility effectively, showing that DP-TAGLMtron achieves comparable performance with only an additional factor of $O(\log N)$ in the utility upper bound.Moreover, our theoretical analysis extends beyond Gaussian-like data distributions to settings with eigenvalue decay, showing how data distribution impacts learning in high dimensions. Notably, our findings suggest that the utility upper bound could be independent of the dimension $d$, even when $d \gg N$. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets also validate our results.</p>

Previous methods for <em>off-policy evaluation</em> (OPE) generally suffer from high variance or irreducible bias, leading to unacceptably high prediction errors. In this work, we introduce STAR, a framework for OPE that encompasses a broad range of estimators -- which include existing OPE methods as special cases -- that achieve lower mean squared prediction errors. STAR leverages state abstraction to distill complex, potentially continuous problems into compact, discrete models which we call <em>abstract reward processes</em> (ARPs). Predictions from ARPs estimated from off-policy data are provably consistent (asymptotically correct). Rather than proposing a specific estimator, we present a new framework for OPE and empirically demonstrate that estimators within STAR outperform existing methods. The best STAR estimator outperforms baselines in all twelve cases studied, and even the median STAR estimator surpasses the baselines in seven out of the twelve cases.</p>

                        <p><p>We consider offline imitation learning (IL), which aims to train an agent to imitate from the dataset of expert demonstrations without online interaction with the environment. Behavioral Cloning (BC) has been a simple yet effective approach to offline IL, but it is also well-known to be vulnerable to the covariate shift resulting from the mismatch between the state distributions induced by the learned policy and the expert policy. Moreover, as often occurs in practice, when expert datasets are collected from an arbitrary state distribution instead of a stationary one, these shifts become more pronounced, potentially leading to substantial failures in existing IL methods. Specifically, we focus on covariate shift resulting from arbitrary state data distributions, such as biased data collection or incomplete trajectories, rather than shifts induced by changes in dynamics or noisy expert actions. In this paper, to mitigate the effect of the covariate shifts in BC, we propose DrilDICE, which utilizes a distributionally robust BC objective by employing a stationary distribution correction ratio estimation (DICE) to derive a feasible solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments covering diverse covariate shift scenarios. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving the robustness against the shifts, outperforming existing offline IL methods in such scenarios.</p>

                        <p><p>While imitation learning requires access to high-quality data, offline reinforcement learning (RL) should, in principle, perform similarly or better with substantially lower data quality by using a value function. However, current results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation learning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline RL. Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in current offline RL algorithms. While poor performance of offline RL is typically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: <em>is the main bottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something else?</em> To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1) value learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline RL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance. We make two surprising observations. First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction algorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL, often more so than the value learning objective. For instance, we show that common value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully leverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained policy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial improvements in performance and scalability. Second, we find that a big barrier to improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on test-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy learning on in-distribution states. We then show that the use of suboptimal but high-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this generalization issue in practice. Specifically, we propose two simple test-time policy improvement methods and show that these methods lead to better performance.</p>

                        <p><p>Queuing network control allows allocation of  scarce resources to manage congestion, a fundamental problem in manufacturing, communications, and healthcare. Compared to standard RL problems, queueing problems  are distinguished by unique challenges: i) a system operating in continuous time, ii) high stochasticity, and iii) long horizons over which the system can become unstable (exploding delays). To provide the empirical foundations for methodological development tackling these challenges, we present an open-sourced  queueing simulation framework, QGym, that benchmark queueing policies across realistic problem instances. Our modular framework allows the researchers to build on our initial instances, which provide a wide range of environments including parallel servers, criss-cross, tandem, and re-entrant networks, as well as a realistically calibrated hospital queuing system.  From these, various policies can be easily tested, including both model-free RL methods and classical queuing policies. Our testbed significantly expands the scope of empirical benchmarking in prior work, and complements thetraditional focus on evaluating algorithms based on mathematical guarantees in idealized settings.

                        <p><p>In the rapidly evolving domain of vision-based deep reinforcement learning (RL), a pivotal challenge is to achieve generalization capability to dynamic environmental changes reflected in visual observations.Our work delves into the intricacies of this problem, identifying two key issues that appear in previous approaches for visual RL generalization: (i) imbalanced saliency and (ii) observational overfitting.Imbalanced saliency is a phenomenon where an RL agent disproportionately identifies salient features across consecutive frames in a frame stack. Observational overfitting occurs when the agent focuses on certain background regions rather than task-relevant objects.To address these challenges, we present a simple yet effective framework for generalization in visual RL (SimGRL) under dynamic scene perturbations.First, to mitigate the imbalanced saliency problem, we introduce an architectural modification to the image encoder to stack frames at the feature level rather than the image level.Simultaneously, to alleviate the observational overfitting problem, we propose a novel technique called shifted random overlay augmentation, which is specifically designed to learn robust representations capable of effectively handling dynamic visual scenes.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization capability of SimGRL, achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks including the DeepMind Control Suite.</p>

However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals—visual observations, actions, and rewards—into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work advances the development of interactive general world models, bridging the gap between generative video models and practical model-based reinforcement learning applications.

                        <p><p>Standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents never intelligently explore like a human (i.e. taking into account complex domain priors and adapting quickly based on previous exploration). Across episodes, RL agents struggle to perform even simple exploration strategies, for example systematic search that avoids exploring the same location multiple times. This poor exploration limits performance on challenging domains. Meta-RL is a potential solution, as unlike standard RL, meta-RL can <em>learn</em> to explore, and potentially learn highly complex strategies far beyond those of standard RL, strategies such as experimenting in early episodes to learn new skills, or conducting experiments to learn about the current environment.Traditional meta-RL focuses on the problem of learning to optimally balance exploration and exploitation to maximize the <em>cumulative reward</em> of the episode sequence (e.g., aiming to maximize the total wins in a tournament -- while also improving as a player).We identify a new challenge with state-of-the-art cumulative-reward meta-RL methods.When optimal behavior requires exploration that sacrifices immediate reward to enable higher subsequent reward, existing state-of-the-art cumulative-reward meta-RL methods become stuck on the local optimum of failing to explore.Our method, First-Explore, overcomes this limitation by learning two policies: one to solely explore, and one to solely exploit. When exploring requires forgoing early-episode reward, First-Explore significantly outperforms existing cumulative meta-RL methods. By identifying and solving the previously unrecognized problem of forgoing reward in early episodes, First-Explore represents a significant step towards developing meta-RL algorithms capable of human-like exploration on a broader range of domains.</p>

                        <p><p>The empirical success of distributional reinforcement learning (RL) highly relies on the choice of distribution divergence equipped with an appropriate distribution representation. In this paper, we propose \textit{Sinkhorn distributional RL (SinkhornDRL)}, which leverages Sinkhorn divergence—a regularized Wasserstein loss—to minimize the difference between current and target Bellman return distributions. Theoretically, we prove the contraction properties of SinkhornDRL, aligning with the interpolation nature of Sinkhorn divergence between Wasserstein distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The introduced SinkhornDRL enriches the family of distributional RL algorithms, contributing to interpreting the algorithm behaviors compared with existing approaches by our investigation into their relationships. Empirically, we show that SinkhornDRL consistently outperforms or matches existing algorithms on the Atari games suite and particularly stands out in the multi-dimensional reward setting. \thanks{Code is available in \url{https://github.com/datake/SinkhornDistRL}.}.</p>

                        <p>Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) agents can struggle to operate across tasks with varying environmental features that require different optimal skills (i.e., different modes of behaviour). Using context encoders based on contrastive learning to enhance the generalisability of Meta-RL agents is now widely studied but faces challenges such as the requirement for a large sample size, also referred to as the $\log$-$K$ curse. To improve RL generalisation to different tasks, we first introduce Skill-aware Mutual Information (SaMI), an optimisation objective that aids in distinguishing context embeddings according to skills, thereby equipping RL agents with the ability to identify and execute different skills across tasks. We then propose Skill-aware Noise Contrastive Estimation (SaNCE), a $K$-sample estimator used to optimise the SaMI objective. We provide a framework for equipping an RL agent with SaNCE in practice and conduct experimental validation on modified MuJoCo and Panda-gym benchmarks. We empirically find that RL agents that learn by maximising SaMI achieve substantially improved zero-shot generalisation to unseen tasks. Additionally, the context encoder trained with SaNCE demonstrates greater robustness to a reduction in the number of available samples, thus possessing the potential to overcome the $\log$-$K$ curse.</p>

                        <p><p>In reinforcement learning with image-based inputs, it is crucial to establish a robust and generalizable state representation. Recent advancements in metric learning, such as deep bisimulation metric approaches, have shown promising results in learning structured low-dimensional representation space from pixel observations, where the distance between states is measured based on task-relevant features. However, these approaches face challenges in demanding generalization tasks and scenarios with non-informative rewards. This is because they fail to capture sufficient long-term information in the learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel State Chrono Representation (SCR) approach. SCR augments state metric-based representations by incorporating extensive temporal information into the update step of bisimulation metric learning. It learns state distances within a temporal framework that considers both future dynamics and cumulative rewards over current and long-term future states. Our learning strategy effectively incorporates future behavioral information into the representation space without introducing a significant number of additional parameters for modeling dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted in DeepMind Control and Meta-World environments demonstrate that SCR achieves better performance comparing to other recent metric-based methods in demanding generalization tasks. The codes of SCR are available in https://github.com/jianda-chen/SCR.</p>

                        <p><p>Policy network parameter sharing is a commonly used technique in advanced deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to improve learning efficiency by reducing the number of policy parameters and sharing experiences among agents. Nevertheless, agents that share the policy parameters tend to learn similar behaviors. To encourage multi-agent diversity, prior works typically maximize the mutual information between trajectories and agent identities using variational inference. However, this category of methods easily leads to inefficient exploration due to limited trajectory visitations. To resolve this limitation, inspired by the learning of pre-trained models, in this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Trajectory Representation (CTR) method based on learning distinguishable trajectory representations to encourage multi-agent diversity. Specifically, CTR maps the trajectory of an agent into a latent trajectory representation space by an encoder and an autoregressive model. To achieve the distinguishability among trajectory representations of different agents, we introduce contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between the trajectory representations and learnable identity representations of different agents. We implement CTR on top of QMIX and evaluate its performance in various cooperative multi-agent tasks. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed CTR yields significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                        <p>We present the first study on provably efficient randomized exploration in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose a unified algorithm framework for randomized exploration in parallel Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and two Thompson Sampling (TS)-type algorithms, CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC, incorporating the perturbed-history exploration (PHE) strategy and the Langevin Monte Carlo exploration (LMC) strategy respectively, which are flexible in design and easy to implement in practice. For a special class of parallel MDPs where the transition is (approximately) linear, we theoretically prove that both CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC achieve a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^2\sqrt{MK})$ regret bound with communication complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dHM^2)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon length, $M$ is the number of agents, and $K$ is the number of episodes. This is the first theoretical result for randomized exploration in cooperative MARL. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple parallel RL environments, including a deep exploration problem (i.e., $N$-chain), a video game, and a real-world problem in energy systems. Our experimental results support that our framework can achieve better performance, even under conditions of misspecified transition models. Additionally, we establish a connection between our unified framework and the practical application of federated learning.</p>

In this paper, we show that partner specialization, in addition to diversity, is crucial for the robustness of a downstream generalist agent. We propose a principled method for quantifying both the diversity and specialization of a partner population based on the concept of mutual information. Then, we observe that the recently proposed cross-play minimization (XP-min) technique produces diverse and specialized partners. However, the generated partners are overfit, reducing their usefulness as training partners. To address this, we propose simple methods, based on reinforcement learning and supervised learning, for extracting the diverse and specialized behaviors of XP-min generated partners but not their overfitness. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed method effectively removes overfitness, and extracted populations produce more robust generalist agents compared to the source XP-min populations.</p>

                        <p><p>In Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is a challenge to learn representations that do not exhibit catastrophic forgetting or interference in non-stationary environments. Successor Features (SFs) offer a potential solution to this challenge. However, canonical techniques for learning SFs from pixel-level observations often lead to representation collapse, wherein representations degenerate and fail to capture meaningful variations in the data. More recent methods for learning SFs can avoid representation collapse, but they often involve complex losses and multiple learning phases, reducing their efficiency. We introduce a novel, simple method for learning SFs directly from pixels. Our approach uses a combination of a Temporal-difference (TD) loss and a reward prediction loss, which together capture the basic mathematical definition of SFs.  We show that our approach matches or outperforms existing SF learning techniques in both 2D (Minigrid) and 3D (Miniworld) mazes, for both single and continual learning scenarios. As well, our technique is efficient, and can reach higher levels of performance in less time than other approaches. Our work provides a new, streamlined technique for learning SFs directly from pixel observations, with no pretraining required.</p>

                        <p><p>In safety-critical RL settings, the inclusion of an additional cost function is often favoured over the arduous task of modifying the reward function to ensure the agent's safe behaviour. However, designing or evaluating such a cost function can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, in the domain of self-driving, designing a cost function that encompasses all unsafe behaviours (e.g., aggressive lane changes, risky overtakes) is inherently complex, it must also consider all the actors present in the scene making it expensive to evaluate. In such scenarios, the cost function can be learned from feedback collected offline in between training rounds. This feedback can be system generated or elicited from a human observing the training process. Previous approaches have not been able to scale to complex environments and are constrained to receiving feedback at the state level which can be expensive to collect. To this end, we introduce an approach that scales to more complex domains and extends beyond state-level feedback, thus, reducing the burden on the evaluator. Inferring the cost function in such settings poses challenges, particularly in assigning credit to individual states based on trajectory-level feedback. To address this, we propose a surrogate objective that transforms the problem into a state-level supervised classification task with noisy labels, which can be solved efficiently. Additionally, it is often infeasible to collect feedback for every trajectory generated by the agent, hence, two fundamental questions arise: (1) Which trajectories should be presented to the human? and (2) How many trajectories are necessary for effective learning? To address these questions, we introduce a \textit{novelty-based sampling} mechanism that selectively involves the evaluator only when the the agent encounters a \textit{novel} trajectory, and discontinues querying once the trajectories are no longer \textit{novel}. We showcase the efficiency of our method through experimentation on several benchmark Safety Gymnasium environments and realistic self-driving scenarios. Our method demonstrates near-optimal performance, comparable to when the cost function is known, by relying solely on trajectory-level feedback across multiple domains. This highlights both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.

                        <p><p>Decision Transformer (DT), as one of the representative Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning (RvS) methods, has achieved strong performance in offline learning tasks by leveraging the powerful Transformer architecture for sequential decision-making. However, in adversarial environments, these methods can be non-robust, since the return is dependent on the strategies of both the decision-maker and adversary. Training a probabilistic model conditioned on observed return to predict action can fail to generalize, as the trajectories that achieve a return in the dataset might have done so due to a suboptimal behavior adversary. To address this, we propose a worst-case-aware RvS algorithm, the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT), which learns and conditions the policy on in-sample minimax returns-to-go. ARDT aligns the target return with the worst-case return learned through minimax expectile regression, thereby enhancing robustness against powerful test-time adversaries. In experiments conducted on sequential games with full data coverage, ARDT can generate a maximin (Nash Equilibrium) strategy, the solution with the largest adversarial robustness. In large-scale sequential games and continuous adversarial RL environments with partial data coverage, ARDT demonstrates significantly superior robustness to powerful test-time adversaries and attains higher worst-case returns compared to contemporary DT methods.</p>

                        <p><p>Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies. Furthermore, the multimodality of diffusion policies also shows the potential of providing the agent with enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on applying diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into online RL has been less investigated. The diffusion model's training objective, known as the variational lower bound, cannot be applied directly in online RL due to the unavailability of 'good' samples (actions). To harmonize the diffusion model with online RL, we propose a novel model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm named Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational loss and its approximate implementation in practice. Notably, this loss is shown to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective. To further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a special entropy regularization term. Unlike Gaussian policies, the log-likelihood in diffusion policies is inaccessible; thus this entropy term is nontrivial. Moreover, to reduce the large variance of diffusion policies, we also develop an efficient behavior policy through action selection. This can further improve its sample efficiency during online interaction. Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies, preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.</p>

Previous Cross-Embodiment RL approaches have focused on transferring knowledge across embodiments within specific tasks. These methods often result in knowledge tightly coupled with those tasks and fail to adequately capture the distinct characteristics of different embodiments. To address this limitation, we introduce the notion of Cross-Embodiment Unsupervised RL (CEURL), which leverages unsupervised learning to enable agents to acquire embodiment-aware and task-agnostic knowledge through online interactions within reward-free environments. We formulate CEURL as a novel Controlled Embodiment Markov Decision Process (CE-MDP) and systematically analyze CEURL's pre-training objectives under CE-MDP. Based on these analyses, we develop a novel algorithm Pre-trained Embodiment-Aware Control (PEAC) for handling CEURL, incorporating an intrinsic reward function specifically designed for cross-embodiment pre-training. PEAC not only provides an intuitive optimization strategy for cross-embodiment pre-training but also can integrate flexibly with existing unsupervised RL methods, facilitating cross-embodiment exploration and skill discovery. Extensive experiments in both simulated (e.g., DMC and Robosuite) and real-world environments (e.g., legged locomotion) demonstrate that PEAC significantly improves adaptation performance and cross-embodiment generalization, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the unique challenges of CEURL.

                        <p><p>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach to complex decision-making. However, one issue that limits its practical application is its brittleness, sometimes failing to train in the presence of small changes in the environment. Motivated by the success of zero-shot transfer—where pre-trained models perform well on related tasks—we consider the problem of selecting a good set of training tasks to maximize generalization performance across a range of tasks. Given the high cost of training, it is critical to select training tasks strategically, but not well understood how to do so. We hence introduce Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), which layers on top of existing RL methods to effectively solve contextual RL problems. MBTL models the generalization performance in two parts: 1) the performance set point, modeled using Gaussian processes, and 2) performance loss (generalization gap), modeled as a linear function of contextual similarity. MBTL combines these two pieces of information within a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to strategically select training tasks. We show theoretically that the method exhibits sublinear regret in the number of training tasks and discuss conditions to further tighten regret bounds. We experimentally validate our methods using urban traffic and standard continuous control benchmarks. The experimental results suggest that MBTL can achieve up to 50x improved sample efficiency compared with canonical independent training and multi-task training. Further experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BO and the insensitivity to the underlying RL algorithm and hyperparameters. This work lays the foundations for investigating explicit modeling of generalization, thereby enabling principled yet effective methods for contextual RL.

                        <p><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods have shown promise in enabling agents to learn a shared communication protocol from scratch and accomplish challenging team tasks. However, the learned language is usually not interpretable to humans or other agents not co-trained together, limiting its applicability in ad-hoc teamwork scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel computational pipeline that aligns the communication space between MARL agents with an embedding space of human natural language by grounding agent communications on synthetic data generated by embodied Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive teamwork scenarios. Our results demonstrate that introducing language grounding not only maintains task performance but also accelerates the emergence of communication. Furthermore, the learned communication protocols exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities in ad-hoc teamwork scenarios with unseen teammates and novel task states. This work presents a significant step toward enabling effective communication and collaboration between artificial agents and humans in real-world teamwork settings.</p>

To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFMs can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.</p>

We refer to this problem as task concept learning and present our approach, Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling (FTL-IGM), which learns new task concepts by leveraging invertible neural generative models. The core idea is to pretrain a generative model on a set of basic concepts and their demonstrations. Then, given a few demonstrations of a new concept (such as a new goal or a new action), our method learns the underlying concepts through backpropagation without updating the model weights, thanks to the invertibility of the generative model. We evaluate our method in five domains -- object rearrangement, goal-oriented navigation, motion caption of human actions, autonomous driving, and real-world table-top manipulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that via the pretrained generative model, we successfully learn novel concepts and generate agent plans or motion corresponding to these concepts in (1) unseen environments and (2) in composition with training concepts.</p>

                        <p><p>The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models.  We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.</p>

The simplest approach to IL, behavior cloning (BC) is thought to incur sample complexity with unfavorable quadratic dependence on the problem horizon, motivating a variety of different online algorithms that attain improved linear horizon dependence under stronger assumptions on the data and the learner’s access to the expert. We revisit the apparent gap between offline and online IL from a learning-theoretic perspective, with a focus on general policy classes up to and including deep neural networks. Through a new analysis of BC with the logarithmic loss, we show that it is possible to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity in offline IL whenever (i) the range of the cumulative payoffs is controlled, and (ii) an appropriate notion of supervised learning complexity for the policy class is controlled. Specializing our results to deterministic, stationary policies, we show that the gap between offline and online IL is not fundamental: (i) it is possible to achieve linear dependence on horizon in offline IL under dense rewards (matching what was previously only known to be achievable in online IL); and (ii) without further assumptions on the policy class, online IL cannot improve over offline IL with the logarithmic loss, even in benign MDPs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard RL tasks and autoregressive language generation to validate the practical relevance of our findings.</p>

To address these challenges, we propose Generate, Improve and Fix with Monte Carlo Tree Search (GIF-MCTS), a new code generation strategy for LLMs. To test our approach in an offline RL setting, we introduce the Code World Models Benchmark (CWMB), a suite of program synthesis and planning tasks comprised of 18 diverse RL environments paired with corresponding textual descriptions and curated trajectories. GIF-MCTS surpasses all baselines on the CWMB and two other benchmarks, and we show that the Code World Models synthesized with it can be successfully used for planning, resulting in model-based RL agents with greatly improved sample efficiency and inference speed.</p>

                        <p><p>General Value Functions (GVFs) (Sutton et al., 2011) represent predictive knowledge in reinforcement learning. Each GVF computes the expected return for a given policy, based on a unique reward. Existing methods relying on fixed behavior policies or pre-collected data often face data efficiency issues when learning multiple GVFs in parallel using off-policy methods. To address this, we introduce <em>GVFExplorer</em>, which adaptively learns a single behavior policy that efficiently collects data for evaluating multiple GVFs in parallel. Our method optimizes the behavior policy by minimizing the total variance in return across GVFs, thereby reducing the required environmental interactions. We use an existing temporal-difference-style variance estimator to approximate the return variance. We prove that each behavior policy update decreases the overall mean squared error in GVF predictions. We empirically show our method's performance in tabular and nonlinear function approximation settings, including Mujoco environments, with stationary and non-stationary reward signals, optimizing data usage and reducing prediction errors across multiple GVFs.</p>

                        <p>We revisit the identification of an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDP). In such MDPs, two measures of complexity have appeared in the literature: the diameter, $D$, and the optimal bias span, $H$, which satisfy $H\leq D$.  Prior work have studied the complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal policy identification only when a generative model is available. In this case, it is known that there exists an MDP with $D \simeq H$ for which the sample complexity to output an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy is $\Omega(SAD/\varepsilon^2)$ where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. Recently, an algorithm with a sample complexity of order $SAH/\varepsilon^2$ has been proposed, but it requires the knowledge of $H$. We first show that the sample complexity required to estimate $H$ is not bounded by any function of $S,A$ and $H$, ruling out the possibility to easily make the previous algorithm agnostic to $H$. By relying instead on a diameter estimation procedure, we propose the first algorithm for $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC policy identification that does not need any form of prior knowledge on the MDP. Its sample complexity scales in $SAD/\varepsilon^2$ in the regime of small $\varepsilon$, which is near-optimal. In the online setting, our first contribution is a lower bound which implies that a sample complexity polynomial in $H$ cannot be achieved in this setting. Then, we propose an online algorithm with a sample complexity in $SAD^2/\varepsilon^2$, as well as a novel approach based on a data-dependent stopping rule that we believe is promising to further reduce this bound.</p>

                        <p><p>Existing metrics for reinforcement learning (RL) such as regret, PAC bounds, or uniform-PAC (Dann et al., 2017), typically evaluate the cumulative performance, while allowing the play of an arbitrarily bad policy at any finite time t. Such a behavior can be highly detrimental in high-stakes applications. This paper introduces a stronger metric, uniform last-iterate (ULI) guarantee, capturing both cumulative and instantaneous performance of RL algorithms. Specifically, ULI characterizes the instantaneous performance since it ensures that the per-round suboptimality of the played policy is bounded by a function, monotonically decreasing w.r.t. (large) round t, preventing revisits to bad policies when sufficient samples are available. We demonstrate that a near-optimal ULI guarantee directly implies near-optimal cumulative performance across aforementioned metrics, but not the other way around. To examine the achievability of ULI, we first provide two positive results for bandit problems with finite arms, showing that some elimination-based algorithms and high-probability adversarial algorithms with stronger analysis or additional designs, can attain near-optimal ULI guarantees. We also provide a negative result, indicating that optimistic algorithms cannot achieve a near-optimal ULI guarantee. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm for linear bandits with infinitely many arms, which achieves the ULI guarantee, given access to an optimization oracle. Finally, we propose an algorithm that achieves a near-optimal ULI guarantee for the online reinforcement learning setting.</p>

One line of research attempting to address these difficultiesmakes the natural assumption that we are given a collection of base or <em>constituent</em> policies (possibly heuristic) upon which we would like to improve in a scalable manner. In this work we aim to compete with the <em>max-following policy</em>, which at each state follows the action of whichever constituent policy has the highest value. The max-following policy is always at least as good as the best constituent policy, and may be considerably better. Our main result is an efficient algorithm that learns to compete with the max-following policy, given only access to the constituent policies (but not their value functions). In contrast to prior work in similar settings, our theoretical results require only the minimal assumption of an ERM oracle for value function approximation for the constituent policies (and not the global optimal policy or the max-following policy itself) on samplable distributions. We illustrate our algorithm's experimental effectiveness and behavior on several robotic simulation testbeds.</p>

                        <p><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful method for controlling dynamic systems, but its learning mechanism can lead to unpredictable actions that undermine the safety of critical systems. Here, we propose RL with Adaptive Regularization (RL-AR), an algorithm that enables safe RL exploration by combining the RL policy with a policy regularizer that hard-codes the safety constraints. RL-AR performs policy combination via a "focus module," which determines the appropriate combination depending on the state—relying more on the safe policy regularizer for less-exploited states while allowing unbiased convergence for well-exploited states. In a series of critical control applications, we demonstrate that RL-AR not only ensures safety during training but also achieves a return competitive with the standards of model-free RL that disregards safety.</p>

                        <p><p>Learning safe policies has presented a longstanding challenge for the reinforcement learning (RL) community. Various formulations of safe RL have been proposed; However, fundamentally, tabula rasa RL must learn safety constraints through experience, which is problematic for real-world applications. Imitation learning is often preferred in real-world settings because the experts' safety preferences are embedded in the data the agent imitates. However, imitation learning is limited in its extensibility to new tasks, which can only be learned by providing the agent with expert trajectories. For safety-critical applications with sub-optimal or inexact expert data, it would be preferable to learn only the safety aspects of the policy through imitation, while still allowing for task learning with  RL. The field of inverse constrained RL, which seeks to infer constraints from expert data, is a promising step in this direction. However, prior work in this area has relied on complex tri-level optimizations in order to infer safe behavior (constraints). This challenging optimization landscape leads to sub-optimal performance on several benchmark tasks. In this work, we present a simplified version of constraint inference that performs as well or better than prior work across a collection of continuous-control benchmarks. Moreover, besides improving performance, this simplified framework is easier to implement, tune, and more readily lends itself to various extensions, such as offline constraint inference.</p>

These results imply a broad set of new, efficient learning algorithms in the recently introduced model of Testable Learning with Distribution Shift (TDS learning) due to Klivans et al. (2023).Our approach generalizes and improves all prior work on TDS learning: (1) we obtain <em>universal</em> learners that succeed simultaneously for large classes of test distributions, (2) achieve near-optimal error rates, and (3) give exponential improvements for constant depth circuits. Our methods further extend to semi-parametric settings and imply the first positive results for low-dimensional convex sets. Additionally, we separate learning and testing phases and obtain algorithms that run in fully polynomial time at test time.</p>

                        <p>Current test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches aim to adapt a machine learning model to environments that change continuously. Yet, it is unclear whether TTA methods can maintain their adaptability over prolonged periods. To answer this question, we introduce a diagnostic setting - **recurring TTA** where environments not only change but also recur over time, creating an extensive data stream. This setting allows us to examine the error accumulation of TTA models, in the most basic scenario, when they are regularly exposed to previous testing environments. Furthermore, we simulate a TTA process on a simple yet representative $\epsilon$-**perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier**, deriving theoretical insights into the dataset- and algorithm-dependent factors contributing to gradual performance degradation. Our investigation leads us to propose **persistent TTA (PeTTA)**, which senses when the model is diverging towards collapse and adjusts the adaptation strategy, striking a balance between the dual objectives of adaptation and model collapse prevention. The supreme stability of PeTTA over existing approaches, in the face of lifelong TTA scenarios, has been demonstrated over comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks.

                        <p><p>In multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the accurate segmentation of the kidney and tumor based on traditional supervised methods typically necessitates detailed annotation for each sequence, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods can effectively mitigate inter-domain differences by aligning cross-modal features, thereby reducing the annotation burden. However, most existing UDA methods are limited to one-to-one domain adaptation, which tends to be inefficient and resource-intensive when faced with multi-target domain transfer tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient One-to-Multiple Progressive Style Transfer Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive (PSTUDA) framework for kidney and tumor segmentation in multi-sequence MRI. Specifically, we develop a multi-level style dictionary to explicitly store the style information of each target domain at various stages, which alleviates the burden of a single generator in a multi-target transfer task and enables effective decoupling of content and style. Concurrently, we employ multiple cascading style fusion modules that utilize point-wise instance normalization to progressively recombine content and style features, which enhances cross-modal alignment and structural consistency. Experiments conducted on the private MSKT and public KiTS19 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PSTUDA over comparative methods in multi-sequence kidney and tumor segmentation. The average Dice Similarity Coefficients are increased by at least 1.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Impressively, our PSTUDA not only significantly reduces the floating-point computation by approximately 72% but also reduces the number of model parameters by about 50%, bringing higher efficiency and feasibility to practical clinical applications.</p>

                        <p><p>Transfer learning is an attractive framework for problems where there is a paucity of data, or where data collection is costly. One common approach to transfer learning is referred to as "model-based", and involves using a model that is pretrained on samples from a source distribution, which is easier to acquire, and then fine-tuning the model on a few samples from the target distribution. The hope is that, if the source and target distributions are "close", then the fine-tuned model will perform well on the target distribution even though it has seen only a few samples from it. In this work, we study the problem of transfer learning in linear models for both regression and binary classification. In particular, we consider the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a linear model initialized with pretrained weights and using a small training data set from the target distribution. In the asymptotic regime of large models, we provide an exact and rigorous analysis and relate the generalization errors (in regression) and classification errors (in binary classification) for the pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, we give conditions under which the fine-tuned model outperforms the pretrained one. An important aspect of our work is that all the results are "universal", in the sense that they depend only on the first and second order statistics of the target distribution. They thus extend well beyond the standard Gaussian assumptions commonly made in the literature.</p>

                        <p><p>Molecular learning is pivotal in many real-world applications, such as drug discovery. Supervised learning requires heavy human annotation, which is particularly challenging for molecular data, e.g., the commonly used density functional theory (DFT) is highly computationally expensive. Active learning (AL) automatically queries labels for most informative samples, thereby remarkably alleviating the annotation hurdle. In this paper, we present a principled AL paradigm for molecular learning, where we treat molecules as 3D molecular graphs. Specifically, we propose a new diversity sampling method to eliminate mutual redundancy built on distributions of 3D geometries. We first propose a set of new 3D graph isometries for 3D graph isomorphism analysis. Our method is provably at least as expressive as the Geometric Weisfeiler-Lehman (GWL) test. The moments of the distributions of the associated geometries are then extracted for efficient diversity computing. To ensure our AL paradigm selects samples with maximal uncertainties, we carefully design a Bayesian geometric graph neural network to compute uncertainties specifically for 3D molecular graphs. We pose active sampling as a quadratic programming (QP) problem using the proposed components. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our AL paradigm, as well as the proposed diversity and uncertainty methods.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper advances temporal reasoning within dynamically changing high-dimensional noisy observations, focusing on a latent space that characterizes the nonlinear dynamics of objects in their environment. We introduce the <em>Gated Inference Network</em> (GIN), an efficient approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for state space models (SSMs) with nonlinear state transitions and emissions. GIN disentangles two latent representations: one representing the object derived from a nonlinear mapping model, and another representing the latent state describing its dynamics. This disentanglement enables direct state estimation and missing data imputation as the world evolves. To infer the latent state, we utilize a deep extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach that integrates a novel compact RNN structure to compute both the Kalman Gain (KG) and smoothing gain (SG), completing the data flow. This design results in a computational cost per step that is linearly faster than EKF but introduces issues such as the exploding gradient problem. To mitigate the exploding gradients caused by the compact RNN structure in our model, we propose a specialized learning method that ensures stable training and inference. The model is then trained end-to-end on videos depicting a diverse range of simulated and real-world physical systems, and outperforms its ounterparts —RNNs, autoregressive models, and variational approaches— in state estimation and missing data imputation tasks.</p>

                        <p><p>Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations.  However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning.  We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data.  In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment, without having access to any in-domain demonstrations.</p>

                        <p><p>Training a policy in a source domain for deployment in the target domain under a dynamics shift can be challenging, often resulting in performance degradation. Previous work tackles this challenge by training on the source domain with modified rewards derived by matching distributions between the source and the target optimal trajectories. However, pure modified rewards only ensure the behavior of the learned policy in the source domain resembles trajectories produced by the target optimal policies, which does not guarantee optimal performance when the learned policy is actually deployed to the target domain. In this work, we propose to utilize imitation learning to transfer the policy learned from the reward modification to the target domain so that the new policy can generate the same trajectories in the target domain. Our approach, Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (DARAIL), utilizes the reward modification for domain adaptation and follows the general framework of generative adversarial imitation learning from observation (GAIfO) by applying a reward augmented estimator for the policy optimization step. Theoretically, we present an error bound for our method under a mild assumption regarding the dynamics shift to justify the motivation of our method. Empirically, our method outperforms the pure modified reward method without imitation learning and also outperforms other baselines in benchmark off-dynamics environments.</p>

These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related but slightly different tasks than what the learner faces.  This setting arises in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information, which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the problem as a zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning setting with an unknown task distribution and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved tasks are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), an empirical Bayes approach that utilizes expert data to establish an informative prior distribution over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making, such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing behaviour cloning and online algorithms, as well as online-offline baselines for multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes (MDPs), and partially observable MDPs, showcasing the broad reach and utility of ExPerior in using expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups.</p>

                        <p><p>Opponent modeling is a longstanding research topic aimed at enhancing decision-making by modeling information about opponents in multi-agent environments. However, existing approaches often face challenges such as having difficulty generalizing to unknown opponent policies and conducting unstable performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on in-context learning and decision-time search named Opponent Modeling with In-context Search (OMIS). OMIS leverages in-context learning-based pretraining to train a Transformer model for decision-making. It consists of three in-context components: an actor learning best responses to opponent policies, an opponent imitator mimicking opponent actions, and a critic estimating state values. When testing in an environment that features unknown non-stationary opponent agents, OMIS uses pretrained in-context components for decision-time search to refine the actor's policy. Theoretically, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, OMIS without search converges in opponent policy recognition and has good generalization properties; with search, OMIS provides improvement guarantees, exhibiting performance stability. Empirically, in competitive, cooperative, and mixed environments, OMIS demonstrates more effective and stable adaptation to opponents than other approaches.

                        <p>We study the problem of nonepisodic reinforcement learning (RL) for nonlinear dynamical systems, where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent has to learn from a single trajectory, i.e., without resets. We propose **N**on**e**pisodic **O**ptistmic **RL** (NeoRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. NeoRL uses well-calibrated probabilistic models and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics. Under continuity and bounded energy assumptions on the system, weprovide a first-of-its-kind regret bound of  $\mathcal{O}(\beta_T \sqrt{T \Gamma_T})$ for general nonlinear systems with Gaussian process dynamics. We compare NeoRL to other baselines on several deep RL environments and empirically demonstrate that NeoRL achieves the optimal average cost while incurring the least regret.</p>

                        <p>While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to a coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when utilities are non-concave -- a common scenario in machine learning applications involving strategies parameterized by deep neural networks, or when agents' utilities are computed by neural networks, or both. Non-concave games introduce significant game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may not exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria, though they exist, are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria generally have infinite support and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges, we revisit the classical solution concept of $\Phi$-equilibria introduced by Greenwald and Jafari [GJ03], which is guaranteed to exist for an arbitrary set of strategy modifications $\Phi$ even in non-concave games [SL07]. However, the tractability of $\Phi$-equilibria in such games remains elusive. In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable $\Phi$-equilibria in non-concave games and examine several natural families of strategy modifications. We show that when $\Phi$ is finite, there exists an efficient uncoupled learning algorithm that approximates the corresponding $\Phi$-equilibria. Additionally, we explore cases where $\Phi$ is infinite but consists of local modifications, showing that Online Gradient Descent can efficiently approximate $\Phi$-equilibria in non-trivial regimes.</p>

                        <p><p>Multi-team games, prevalent in robotics and resource management, involve team members striving for a joint best response against other teams. Team-Nash equilibrium (TNE) predicts the outcomes of such coordinated interactions. However, can teams of self-interested agents reach TNE? We introduce Team-Fictitious Play (Team-FP), a new variant of fictitious play where agents respond to the last actions of team members and the beliefs formed about other teams with some inertia in action updates. This design is essential in team coordination beyond the classical fictitious play dynamics. We focus on zero-sum potential team games (ZSPTGs) where teams can interact pairwise while the team members do not necessarily have identical payoffs. We show that Team-FP reaches near TNE in ZSPTGs with a quantifiable error bound. We extend Team-FP dynamics to multi-team Markov games for model-based and model-free cases. The convergence analysis tackles the challenge of non-stationarity induced by evolving opponent strategies based on the optimal coupling lemma and stochastic differential inclusion approximation methods. Our work strengthens the foundation for using TNE to predict the behavior of decentralized teams and offers a practical rule for team learning in multi-team environments. We provide extensive simulations of Team-FP dynamics and compare its performance with other widely studied dynamics such as smooth fictitious play and multiplicative weights update. We further explore how different parameters impact the speed of convergence.</p>

                        <p>The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for this problem of $1/e \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s. Much more recently, the study of algorithms with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront which can be used to improve the algorithm's performance. Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior knowledge, we tackle the following question: _What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/e$ barrier?_To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap. As in the classical problem, weights are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order. In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an _additive gap_ $c$. This gap is the difference between the highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence.Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does not make the problem trivial. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent bound for the classical problem by a constant. Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction.</p>

                        <p><p>In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory, agents repeatedly interact and revise their strategies as new data arrives, producing a sequence of strategy profiles. This paper studies sequences of strategies satisfying a pairwise constraint inspired by policy updating in reinforcement learning, where an agent who is best responding in one period does not switch its strategy in the next period. This constraint merely requires that optimizing agents do not switch strategies, but does not constrain the non-optimizing agents in any way, and thus allows for exploration. Sequences with this property are called satisficing paths, and arise naturally in many MARL algorithms.  A fundamental question about strategic dynamics is such: for a given game and initial strategy profile, is it always possible to construct a satisficing path that terminates at an equilibrium? The resolution of this question has implications about the capabilities or limitations of a class of MARL algorithms. We answer this question in the affirmative for normal-form games. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that suboptimal, and perhaps even reward deteriorating, strategic updates are key to driving play to equilibrium along a satisficing path.</p>

The idea is to plan an agent's own actions with respect to those types which it believes are most likely to maximize the payoff. However, the type beliefs are often learned from past actions and likely to be incorrect. With this perspective in mind, we consider an agent in a game with type predictions of other components, and investigate the impact of incorrect beliefs to the agent’s payoff. In particular, we formally define a tradeoff between risk and opportunity by comparing the payoff obtained against the optimal payoff, which is represented by a gap caused by trusting or distrusting the learned beliefs.Our main results characterize the tradeoff by establishing upper and lower bounds on the Pareto front for both normal-form and stochastic Bayesian games, with numerical results provided.</p>

                        <p>We study a setting where agents use no-regret learning algorithms to participate in repeated auctions. Recently, Kolumbus and Nisan [2022a] showed, rather surprisingly, that when bidders participate in second-price auctions using no-regret bidding algorithms, no matter how large the number of interactions $T$ is, the runner-up bidder may not converge to bidding truthfully. Our first result shows that this holds forall deterministictruthful auctions. We also show that the ratio of the learning rates of different bidders can qualitatively affect the convergence of the bidders. Next, we consider the problem of revenue maximization in this environment. In the setting with fully rational bidders, the seminal result of Myerson [1981] showed that revenue can be maximized by using a second-price auction with reserves. We show that, in stark contrast, in our setting with learning bidders, randomized auctions can have strictly better revenue guarantees than second-price auctions with reserves, when $T$ is large enough. To do this, we provide a black-box transformation from any truthful auction $A$ to an auction $A'$ such that: i) all mean-based no-regret learners that participate in $A'$ converge to bidding truthfully, ii) the distance between the allocation rule and the payment rule between $A, A'$ is negligible. Finally, we study revenue maximization in the non-asymptotic regime. We define a notion of auctioneer regret that compares the revenue generated to the revenue of a second price auction with truthful bids. When the auctioneer has to use the same auction throughout the interaction, we show an (almost) tight regret bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{3/4})$. Then, we consider the case where the auctioneer can use different auctions throughout the interaction, but in a way that is oblivious to the bids. For this setting, we show an (almost) tight bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$.</p>

                        <p>We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to two groups of buyers in every round, for a total of $T$ rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case ($T=1$) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the group which otherwise has a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on one hand, commits to a participation reward to incentivize truth-telling, and, on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization in favor of one group, where the extent of subsidization depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the other. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently.</p>

Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in some cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the dataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators. We propose a novel approximation, referred to as discrete uniform Shapley, which is expressed as an expectation under a discrete uniform distribution with support of reasonable size. We justify the relevancy of the proposed framework via asymptotic and non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees and illustrate its benefits via an extensive set of numerical experiments.</p>

In this work, we present a comprehensive formulation of the binary decision making problem and provide a detailed characterization of the optimal solution. Our framework encompasses a wide range of well-known and recently proposed decision making problems as specific cases. We demonstrate how our generic approach can be used to derive the optimal decision strategies for these diverse instances.

                        <p><p>Rapid model validation via the train-test paradigm has been a key driver for the breathtaking progress in machine learning and AI. However, modern AI systems often depend on a combination of tasks and data collection practices that violate all assumptions ensuring test validity. Yet, without rigorous model validation we cannot ensure the intended outcomes of deployed AI systems, including positive social impact, nor continue to advance AI research in a scientiﬁcally sound way. In this paper, I will show that for widely considered inference settings in complex social systems the train-test paradigm does not only lack a justiﬁcation but is indeed invalid for any risk estimator, including counterfactual and causal estimators, with high probability. These formal impossibility results highlight a fundamental epistemic issue, i.e., that for key tasks in modern AI we cannot know whether models are valid under current data collection practices. Importantly, this includes variants of both recommender systems and reasoning via large language models, and neither naïve scaling nor limited benchmarks are suited to address this issue. I am illustrating these results via the widely used MovieLens benchmark and conclude by discussing the implications of these results for AI in social systems, including possible remedies such as participatory data curation and open science.</p>

                        <p><p>Formal language theory has recently been successfully employed to unravel     the power of transformer encoders. This setting is primarily applicable in    Natural Language Processing (NLP), as a token embedding function (where    a bounded number of tokens is admitted) is first applied before feeding     the input to the transformer.     On certain kinds of data (e.g. time     series), we want our transformers to be able to handle arbitrary    input sequences of numbers (or tuples thereof) without a priori    limiting the values of these numbers. In this    paper, we initiate the study of the expressive power of transformer encoders    on sequences of data (i.e. tuples of numbers).    Our results indicate an increase in expressive power of     hard attention transformers over data sequences, in stark contrast to the     case of strings.    In particular, we prove that Unique Hard Attention Transformers (UHAT) over     inputs as data sequences no longer lie within the circuit complexity     class AC0 (even without positional encodings), unlike the case of string    inputs,     but are still within the complexity class TC0 (even with positional    encodings). Over strings, UHAT without positional encodings capture only    regular languages. In contrast, we show that over data sequences    UHAT can capture non-regular properties.    Finally, we show that UHAT capture languages     definable in an extension of linear temporal logic with unary numeric    predicates and arithmetics.</p>

                        <p><p>We use fixed point theory to analyze nonnegative neural networks, which we define as neural networks that map nonnegative vectors to nonnegative vectors. We first show that nonnegative neural networks with nonnegative weights and biases can be recognized as monotonic and (weakly) scalable mappings within the framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact enables us to provide conditions for the existence of fixed points of nonnegative neural networks having inputs and outputs of the same dimension, and these conditions are weaker than those recently obtained  using arguments in convex analysis. Furthermore, we prove that the shape of the fixed point set of nonnegative neural networks with nonnegative weights and biases is an interval, which under mild conditions degenerates to a point. These results are then used to obtain the existence of fixed points of more general nonnegative neural networks. From a practical perspective, our results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of autoencoders, and we also offer valuable mathematical machinery for future developments in deep equilibrium models.</p>

Here $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is the effective rank (ratio of the trace and the principal eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Under this computational budget, we consider the problem of sparse PCA, where the principal eigenvector of $\Sigma$ is $s$-sparse, and $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ can be large. In this setting, to our knowledge, *there are no known single-pass algorithms* that achieve the minimax error bound in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time without either requiring strong initialization conditions or assuming further structure (e.g., spiked) of the covariance matrix.We show that a simple single-pass procedure that thresholds the output of Oja's algorithm (the Oja vector) can achieve the minimax error bound under some regularity conditions in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time.  We present a nontrivial and novel analysis of the entries of the unnormalized Oja vector, which involves the projection of a product of independent random matrices on a random initial vector. This is completely different from previous analyses of Oja's algorithm and matrix products, which have been done when the $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is bounded.</p>

                        <p>Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is an approach to facilitate the learning process of agents by structuring tasks in a sequence of increasing complexity. Despite its potential, many existing CRL methods struggle to efficiently guide agents toward desired outcomes, particularly in the absence of domain knowledge. This paper introduces DiCuRL (Diffusion Curriculum Reinforcement Learning), a novel method that leverages conditional diffusion models to generate curriculum goals. To estimate how close an agent is to achieving its goal, our method uniquely incorporates a $Q$-function and a trainable reward function based on Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation within the diffusion model. Furthermore, it promotes exploration through the inherent noising and denoising mechanism present in the diffusion models and is environment-agnostic. This combination allows for the generation of challenging yet achievable goals, enabling agents to learn effectively without relying on domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiCuRL in three different maze environments and two robotic manipulation tasks simulated in MuJoCo, where it outperforms or matches nine state-of-the-art CRL algorithms from the literature.</p>

                        <p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are too costly to use in practice due to the large sizes $S,A$ of the problem's state and action space. To resolve this issue, we study transfer RL with latent low rank structure. We consider the problem of transferring a latent low rank representation when the source and target MDPs have transition kernels with Tucker rank $(S, d, A)$, $(S ,S , d), (d, S , A )$, or $(d , d , d )$. In each setting, we introduce the transfer-ability coefficient $\alpha$ that measures the difficulty of representational transfer. Our algorithm learns latent representations in each source MDP and then exploits the linear structure to remove the dependence on $S , A $, or $SA $ in the target MDP regret bound. We complement our positive results with information theoretic lower bounds that show our algorithms (excluding the ($d, d, d$) setting) are minimax-optimal with respect to $\alpha$.</p>

                        <p><p>Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a powerful and theoretically sound methodology for sequential decision-making. However, it is not directly applicable to Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to the inaccessibility of explicit action-value functions. We address this challenge by introducing a novel approach based on learning a world model of the environment using conditional mean embeddings. Leveraging tools from operator theory we derive a closed-form expression of the action-value function in terms of the world model via simple matrix operations. Combining these estimators with PMD leads to POWR, a new RL algorithm for which we prove convergence rates to the global optimum. Preliminary experiments in finite and infinite state settings support the effectiveness of our method.</p>

                        <p>In this paper, we address the challenges of offline reinforcement learning (RL) under model mismatch, where the agent aims to optimize its performance through an offline dataset that may not accurately represent the deployment environment. We identify two primary challenges under the setting: inaccurate model estimation due to limited data and performance degradation caused by the model mismatch between the dataset-collecting environment and the target deployment one. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified principle of pessimism using distributionally robust Markov decision processes. We carefully construct a robust MDP with a single uncertainty set to tackle both data sparsity and model mismatch, and demonstrate that the optimal robust policy enjoys a near-optimal sub-optimality gap under the target environment across three widely used uncertainty models: total variation, $\chi^2$ divergence, and KL divergence. Our results improve upon or match the state-of-the-art performance under the total variation and KL divergence models, and provide the first result for the $\chi^2$ divergence model.</p>

                        <p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\text{\textit{concentrability}}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p>

                        <p>We study the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium (NE) in Markov games which is a cornerstone in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In particular, we focus on infinite-horizon adversarial team Markov games (ATMGs) in which agents that share a common reward function compete against a single opponent, *the adversary*. These games unify two-player zero-sum Markov games and Markov potential games, resulting in a setting that encompasses both collaboration and competition. Kalogiannis et al. (2023) provided an efficient equilibrium computation algorithm for ATMGs which presumes knowledge of the reward and transition functions and has no sample complexity guarantees. We contribute a learning algorithm that utilizes MARL policy gradient methods with iteration and sample complexity that is polynomial in the approximation error $\epsilon$ and the natural parameters of the ATMG, resolving the main caveats of the solution by (Kalogiannis et al., 2023). It is worth noting that previously, the existence of learning algorithms for NE was known for Markov two-player zero-sum and potential games but not for ATMGs.    Seen through the lens of min-max optimization, computing a NE in these games consists a nonconvex--nonconcave saddle-point problem. Min-max optimization has received an extensive study. Nevertheless, the case of nonconvex--nonconcave landscapes remains elusive: in full generality, finding saddle-points is computationally intractable (Daskalakis et al., 2021). We circumvent the aforementioned intractability by developing techniques that exploit the hidden structure of the objective function via a nonconvex--concave reformulation. However, this introduces a challenge of a feasibility set with coupled constraints. We tackle these challenges by establishing novel techniques for optimizing weakly-smooth nonconvex functions, extending the framework of (Devolder et al., 2014).</p>

                        <p><p>Code generation models have increasingly become integral to aiding software development. Although current research has thoroughly examined the correctness of the code produced by code generation models, a vital aspect that plays a pivotal role in greencomputing and sustainability efforts — the efficiency of the generated code — has often been neglected. This paper presents Effibench, a benchmark with 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems to assess the efficiency of code generated by code generation models. EffiBench contains a diverse set of LeetCode coding problems. Each problem is paired with an executable human-written canonical solution, which obtains the SOTA efficiency on the LeetCode solution leaderboard. With EffiBench, we empirically examine the ability of 42 large language models (35 open-source and 7 closed-source) to generate efficient code. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the efficiency of the code generated by LLMs is generally worse than the efficiency of human-written canonical solutions. For example, GPT-4 generated code has an average \textbf{3.12} times execution time that of the human-written canonical solutions. In the most extreme cases, the execution time and total memory usage of GPT-4 code are \textbf{13.89} and \textbf{43.92} times that of the canonical solutions. The source code of EffiBench is released on \url{ https://github.com/huangd1999/EffiBench }.

                        <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed.In light of this research gap, this paper introduces $\texttt{Model-GLUE}$, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, $\texttt{Model-GLUE}$ shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61\%, achieved without additional training.Codes are available at: \url{https://github.com/Model-GLUE/Model-GLUE}.</p>

                        <p><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently gained much attention for its outstanding generalization to unseen data and tasks. Despite its promising prospect, the vulnerabilities of SAM, especially to universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we propose DarkSAM, the first prompt-free universal attack framework against SAM, including a semantic decoupling-based spatial attack and a texture distortion-based frequency attack. We first divide the output of SAM into foreground and background. Then, we design a shadow target strategy to obtain the semantic blueprint of the image as the attack target. DarkSAM is dedicated to fooling SAM by extracting and destroying crucial object features from images in both spatial and frequency domains. In the spatial domain, we disrupt the semantics of both the foreground and background in the image to confuse SAM. In the frequency domain, we further enhance the attack effectiveness by distorting the high-frequency components (i.e., texture information) of the image. Consequently, with a single UAP, DarkSAM renders SAM incapable of segmenting objects across diverse images with varying prompts. Experimental results on four datasets for SAM and its two variant models demonstrate the powerful attack capability and transferability of DarkSAM.

                        <p><p>Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a flexible framework for sampling from high dimensional data distributions. DDMs generate a path of probability distributions interpolating between a reference Gaussian distribution and a data distribution by incrementally injecting noise into the data. To numerically simulate the sampling process, a discretisation schedule from the reference back towards clean data must be chosen. An appropriate discretisation schedule is crucial to obtain high quality samples. However, beyond hand crafted heuristics, a general method for choosing this schedule remains elusive. This paper presents a novel algorithm for adaptively selecting an optimal discretisation schedule with respect to a cost that we derive. Our cost measures the work done by the simulation procedure to transport samples from one point in the diffusion path to the next. Our method does not require hyperparameter tuning and adapts to the dynamics and geometry of the diffusion path. Our algorithm only involves the evaluation of the estimated Stein score, making it scalable to existing pre-trained models at inference time and online during training. We find that our learned schedule recovers performant schedules previously only discovered through manual search and obtains competitive FID scores on image datasets.</p>

                        <p>We study the batched best arm identification (BBAI) problem, where the learner's goal is to identify the best arm while switching the policy as less as possible. In particular, we aim to find the best arm with probability $1-\delta$ for some small constant $\delta>0$ while minimizing both the sample complexity (total number of arm pulls) and the batch complexity (total number of batches). We propose the three-batch best arm identification (Tri-BBAI) algorithm, which is the first batched algorithm that achieves the optimal sample complexity in the asymptotic setting (i.e., $\delta\rightarrow 0$) and runs in $3$ batches in expectation. Based on Tri-BBAI, we further propose the almost optimal batched best arm identification (Opt-BBAI) algorithm, which is the first algorithm that achieves the near-optimal sample and batch complexity in the non-asymptotic setting (i.e., $1/\delta$ is finite), while enjoying the same batch and sample complexity as Tri-BBAI when $\delta$ tends to zero. Moreover, in the non-asymptotic setting, the complexity of previous batch algorithms is usually conditioned on the event that the best arm is returned (with a probability of at least $1-\delta$), which is potentially unbounded in cases where a sub-optimal arm is returned. In contrast, the complexity of Opt-BBAI does not rely on such an event. This is achieved through a novel procedure that we design for checking whether the best arm is eliminated, which is of independent interest.</p>

Despite their success in discrete spaces, such as text generation tasks, the acceleration of discrete diffusion models remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose discrete non-Markov diffusion models (DNDM), which naturally induce the predetermined transition time set. This enables a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly reduces the number of function evaluations (i.e., calls to the neural network), making the sampling process much faster. Furthermore, we study the transition from finite to infinite step sampling, offering new insights into bridging the gap between discrete and continuous-time processes for discrete diffusion models. Extensive experiments on natural language generation and machine translation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of both generation speed and sample quality compared to existing methods for discrete diffusion models.

While a myriad of powerful deep learning models have been developed for this task, few works have explored the robustness of MTS forecasting models to malicious attacks, which is crucial for their trustworthy employment in high-stake scenarios. To address this gap, we dive deep into the backdoor attacks on MTS forecasting models and propose an effective attack method named BackTime. By subtly injecting a few \textit{stealthy triggers} into the MTS data, BackTime can alter the predictions of the forecasting model according to the attacker's intent. Specifically, BackTime first identifies vulnerable timestamps in the data for poisoning, and then adaptively synthesizes stealthy and effective triggers by solving a bi-level optimization problem with a GNN-based trigger generator. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art MTS forecasting models demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, and stealthiness of BackTime attacks.</p>

                        <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for complex tasks that require multiple generation calls, advanced prompting techniques, control flow, and structured inputs/outputs. However, efficient systems are lacking for programming and executing these applications. We introduce SGLang, a system for efficient execution of complex language model programs. SGLang consists of a frontend language and a runtime. The frontend simplifies programming with primitives for generation and parallelism control. The runtime accelerates execution with novel optimizations like RadixAttention for KV cache reuse and compressed finite state machines for faster structured output decoding. Experiments show that SGLang achieves up to $6.4\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art inference systems on various large language and multi-modal models on tasks including agent control, logical reasoning, few-shot learning benchmarks, JSON decoding, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, and multi-turn chat.

                        <p><p>Federated Learning (FL) has recently been applied to the parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). While promising, it raises significant challenges due to the heterogeneous resources and data distributions of clients.This study introduces FlexLoRA, a simple yet effective  aggregation scheme for LLM fine-tuning, which mitigates the "buckets effect" in traditional FL that restricts the potential of clients with ample resources by tying them to the capabilities of the least-resourced participants. FlexLoRA allows for dynamic adjustment of local LoRA ranks, fostering the development of a global model imbued with broader, less task-specific knowledge. By synthesizing a full-size LoRA weight from individual client contributions and employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for weight redistribution, FlexLoRA fully leverages heterogeneous client resources. Involving thousands of clients performing heterogeneous NLP tasks and client resources, our experiments validate the efficacy of FlexLoRA, with the federated global model achieving consistently better improvement over SOTA FL methods in downstream NLP task performance across various heterogeneous distributions. FlexLoRA's practicality is further underscored by our theoretical analysis and its seamless integration with existing LoRA-based FL methods, offering a path toward cross-device, privacy-preserving federated tuning for LLMs.</p>

                        <p>Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies *amortized* sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, *relative trajectory balance*, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.

                        <p><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful paradigm for aligning foundation models to human values and preferences. However, current RLHF techniques cannot account for the naturally occurring differences in individual human preferences across a diverse population. When these differences arise, traditional RLHF frameworks simply average over them, leading to inaccurate rewards and poor performance for individual subgroups. To address the need for pluralistic alignment, we develop a class of multimodal RLHF methods. Our proposed techniques are based on a latent variable formulation - inferring a novel user-specific latent and learning reward models and policies conditioned on this latent without additional user-specific data. While conceptually simple, we show that in practice, this reward modeling requires careful algorithmic considerations around model architecture and reward scaling. To empirically validate our proposed technique, we first show that it can provide a way to combat underspecification in simulated control problems, inferring and optimizing user-specific reward functions. Next, we conduct experiments on pluralistic language datasets representing diverse user preferences and demonstrate improved reward function accuracy. We additionally show the benefits of this probabilistic framework in terms of measuring uncertainty, and actively learning user preferences. This work enables learning from diverse populations of users with divergent preferences, an important challenge that naturally occurs in problems from robot learning to foundation model alignment.</p>

Current MLLMs primarily focus on single-image visual understanding, limiting their ability to interpret and integrate information across multiple images. MaVEn addresses this limitation by combining discrete visual symbol sequences, which abstract coarse-grained semantic concepts, with traditional continuous representation sequences that model fine-grained features. This dual approach bridges the semantic gap between visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to process and interpret information from multiple images effectively. Additionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence continuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in complex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image contexts.</p>

                        <p><p>In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial. It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback. This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks. Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs. In this work, we propose LeDex, a training framework that significantly improves the self-debugging capability of LLMs. Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement. We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories from the LLM itself or a larger teacher model and filtering via execution verification. We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality. SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92\% and pass@10 by 9.30\% over four benchmarks. RL training brings additional up to 3.54\% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55\% improvement on pass@10. The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability and can keep refining code continuously. Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code.</p>

                        <p><p>Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content. This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which has been shown to successfully jailbreak multiple open-source LLMs. Drawing inspiration from the difficulties of discrete token optimization, our method relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization process while gradually increasing the sparsity of the optimizing vectors. This technique effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art token-level methods. On Harmbench, our approach achieves the highest attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs compared to the latest jailbreak methods. \textcolor{red}{Trigger Warning: This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature.}</p>

                        <p><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.</p>

                        <p>When learning vision-language models (VLM) for the fashion domain, most existing works design new architectures from vanilla BERT with additional objectives, or perform dense multi-task learning with fashion-specific tasks. Though progress has been made, their architecture or objectives are often intricate and the extendibility is limited.By contrast, with simple architecture (comprising only two unimodal encoders) and just the contrastive objective, popular pre-trained VL models (e.g., CLIP) achieve superior performance in general domains, which are further easily extended to downstream tasks.However, inheriting such benefits of CLIP in the fashion domain is non-trivial in the presence of the notable domain gap. Empirically, we find that directly finetuning on fashion data leads CLIP to frequently ignore minor yet important details such as logos and composition, which are critical in fashion tasks such as retrieval and captioning.In this work, to maintain CLIP's simple architecture and objective while explicitly attending to fashion details, we propose $E^2$: Easy Regional Contrastive Learning of Expressive Fashion Representations.$E^2$ introduces only a few selection tokens and fusion blocks (just 1.9\% additional parameters in total) with only contrastive losses. Despite lightweight, in our primary focus, cross-modal retrieval, $E^2$ notably outperforms existing fashion VLMs with various fashion-specific objectives.Moreover, thanks to CLIP's widespread use in downstream tasks in general domains (e.g., zero-shot composed image retrieval and image captioning), our model can easily extend these models  from general domain to the fashion domain with notable improvement.To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we further collect data from Amazon Reviews to build a new dataset for cross-modal retrieval in the fashion domain.</p>

                        <p><p>Diffusion distillation represents a highly promising direction for achieving faithful text-to-image generation in a few sampling steps. However, despite recent successes, existing distilled models still do not provide the full spectrum of diffusion abilities, such as real image inversion, which enables many precise image manipulation methods. This work aims to enrich distilled text-to-image diffusion models with the ability to effectively encode real images into their latent space. To this end, we introduce invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation framework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image encoding in only 3-4 inference steps. Though the inversion problem for text-to-image diffusion models gets exacerbated by high classifier-free guidance scales, we notice that dynamic guidance significantly reduces reconstruction errors without noticeable degradation in generation performance. As a result, we demonstrate that iCD equipped with dynamic guidance may serve as a highly effective tool for zero-shot text-guided image editing, competing with more expensive state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

                        <p>We develop a technique to design efficiently computable estimators for sparse linear regression in the simultaneous presence of two adversaries: oblivious and adaptive.Consider the model $y^*=X^*\beta^*+ \eta$ where $X^*$ is an $n\times d$ random design matrix, $\beta^*\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-sparse vector, and the noise $\eta$ is independent of $X^*$ and chosen by the \emph{oblivious adversary}. Apart from the independence of $X^*$, we only require a small fraction entries of $\eta$ to have magnitude at most $1$. The \emph{adaptive adversary} is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the samples $(X_1^*, y_1^*),\ldots, (X_n^*, y_n^*)$.Given the $\varepsilon$-corrupted samples $(X_1, y_1),\ldots, (X_n, y_n)$, the goal is to estimate $\beta^*$.  We assume that the rows of $X^*$ are iid samples from some $d$-dimensional distribution $\mathcal{D}$  with zero mean and (unknown) covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with bounded condition number.We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of the art even in the special case of Gaussian noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)^n$. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability recovers $\beta^*$ up to error $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$  as long as  $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^2/\varepsilon)$, only assuming some bounds on the third and the fourth moments of $\mathcal{D}$. In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$ and noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)$, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$.  We show that under some assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of $\mathcal{D}$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^4 / \varepsilon^3)$. For Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$, this algorithm achieves error $O(\varepsilon^{3/4})$. Moreover, our algorithm achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for all log-concave distributions if $\varepsilon \le 1/\text{polylog(d)}$. Our algorithms are based on the filtering  of the covariates that uses sum-of-squares relaxations, and weighted Huber loss minimization with $\ell_1$ regularizer.  We provide a novel analysis of weighted penalized Huber loss that is suitable for heavy-tailed designs in the presence of two adversaries. Furthermore, we complement our algorithmic results with Statistical Query lower bounds, providing evidence that our estimators are likely to have nearly optimal sample complexity.</p>

                        <p><p>Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for the creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p>

                        <p>In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pretrained large language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples during inference. However, theoretical understanding of ICL is largely under-explored, particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseen examples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire contextual knowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates the training dynamics of  transformers by gradient descent through the lens of non-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attained via  learning  the template function for each task in-context, where all template functions lie in a linear space with $m$ basis functions. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer multi-head transformers to {in-contextly} predict unlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts, where the labels contain Gaussian noise and the number of examples in each prompt  are not sufficient to determine the template. Under mild assumptions, we show that the training loss for a one-layer multi-head transformer converges linearly to a global minimum. Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression over the basis functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first provable demonstration that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template) information to generalize to both unseen examples and tasks when prompts contain only a small number of query-answer pairs.</p>

                        <p>Uniformity testing is arguably one of the most fundamental distribution testing problems. Given sample access to an unknown distribution $\mathbf{p}$ on $[n]$, one must decide if $\mathbf{p}$ is uniform or $\varepsilon$-far from uniform (in total variation distance). A long line of work established that uniformity testing has sample complexity $\Theta(\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-2})$. However, when the input distribution is neither uniform nor far from uniform, known algorithms may have highly non-replicable behavior. Consequently, if these algorithms are applied in scientific studies, they may lead to contradictory results that erode public trust in science.In this work, we revisit uniformity testing under the framework of algorithmic replicability [STOC '22], requiring the algorithm to be replicable under arbitrary distributions. While replicability typically incurs a $\rho^{-2}$ factor overhead in sample complexity, we obtain a replicable uniformity tester using only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} \varepsilon^{-2} \rho^{-1})$ samples. To our knowledge, this is the first replicable learning algorithm with (nearly) linear dependence on $\rho$.Lastly, we consider a class of ``symmetric" algorithms [FOCS '00] whose outputs are invariant under relabeling of the domain $[n]$, which includes all existing uniformity testers (including ours). For this natural class of algorithms, we prove a nearly matching sample complexity lower bound for replicable uniformity testing.</p>

                        <p><p>Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior. Experimental results show that our method outperforms LDR/HDR 3DGS and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models in both reconstruction quality and inference speed on the RawNeRF dataset across a broad range of training views. We will release the code upon paper acceptance.</p>

                        <p><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches are resource-intensive and may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR significantly enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across twelve benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62\%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning.</p>

                        <p><p>Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) has attracted significant attention for addressing catastrophic forgetting in semi-supervised data. Knowledge distillation, which leverages data representation and pair-wise similarity, has shown significant potential in preserving information in SSCL. However, traditional distillation strategies often fail in unlabeled data with inaccurate or noisy information, limiting their efficiency in feature spaces undergoing substantial changes during continual learning. To address these limitations, we propose Persistence Homology Distillation (PsHD) to preserve intrinsic structural information that is insensitive to noise in semi-supervised continual learning. First, we capture the structural features using persistence homology by homological evolution across different scales in vision data, where the multi-scale characteristic established its stability under noise interference. Next, we propose a persistence homology distillation loss in SSCL and design an acceleration algorithm to reduce the computational cost of persistence homology in our module. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior stability of PsHD compared to sample representation and pair-wise similarity distillation methods theoretically and experimentally. Finally, experimental results on three widely used datasets validate that the new PsHD outperforms state-of-the-art with 3.9% improvements on average, and also achieves 1.5%  improvements while reducing 60% memory buffer size, highlighting the potential of utilizing unlabeled data in SSCL.

                    <div class="abstract">
                        <p>Data selection has emerged as a core issue for large-scale visual-language model pretaining (e.g., CLIP), particularly with noisy web-curated datasets. Three main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP models to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that are more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP model, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore is one popular metric).  While the first two approaches have been extensively studied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third approach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP scores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single sample, we introduce $\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$,  a method inspired by CLIP training loss that adds the alignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra normalization term to CLIPScore for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream tasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, $\textbf{NormSim}$, to measure the similarity between pretraining data and target data. We test our methods on the data selection benchmark, DataComp [Gadre et al., 2023]. Compared to the best baseline using only OpenAI's CLIP-L/14, our methods achieve a 5.3\% improvement on ImageNet-1k and a 2.8\% improvement on 38 downstream evaluation tasks. Moreover, both $\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$ and $\textbf{NormSim}$ are compatible with existing techniques. By combining our methods with the current best methods DFN [Fang et al., 2023] and HYPE [Kim et al., 2024], we can boost average performance on downstream tasks by 0.9\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the DataComp-medium benchmark.</p>

                        <p><p>In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle various tasks by providing input-output examples as additional inputs, referred to as demonstrations. Nevertheless, the performance of ICL could be easily impacted by the quality of selected demonstrations. Existing efforts generally learn a retriever model to score each demonstration for selecting suitable demonstrations, however, the effect is suboptimal due to the large search space and the noise from unhelpful demonstrations. In this study, we introduce MoD, which partitions the demonstration pool into groups, each governed by an expert to reduce search space. We further design an expert-wise training strategy to alleviate the impact of unhelpful demonstrations when optimizing the retriever model. During inference, experts collaboratively retrieve demonstrations for the input query to enhance the  ICL performance. We validate MoD via experiments across a range of NLP datasets and tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and shedding new light on the future design of retrieval methods for ICL.</p>

                        <p><p>Vision-language (VL) embedding models have been shown to encode biases present in their training data, such as societal biases that prescribe negative characteristics to members of various racial and gender identities. Due to their wide-spread adoption for various tasks ranging from few-shot classification to text-guided image generation, debiasing VL models is crucial. Debiasing approaches that fine-tune the VL model often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, fine-tuning-free methods typically utilize a ``one-size-fits-all" approach that assumes that correlation with the spurious attribute can be explained using a single linear direction across all possible inputs. In this work, we propose a nonlinear, fine-tuning-free approach for VL embedding model debiasing that tailors the debiasing operation to each unique input. This allows for a more flexible debiasing approach. Additionally, we do not require knowledge of the set of inputs a priori to inference time, making our method more appropriate for online tasks such as retrieval and text guided image generation.</p>

                        <p>We propose a novel and general method to learn Bregman divergences from raw high-dimensional data that measure similarity between images in pixel space. As a prototypical application, we learn divergences that consider real-world corruptions of images (e.g., blur) as close to the original and noisy perturbations as far, even if in $L^p$-distance the opposite holds. We also show that the learned Bregman divergence excels on datasets of human perceptual similarity judgment, suggesting its utility in a range of applications. We then define adversarial attacks by replacing the projected gradient descent (PGD) with the mirror descent associated with the learned Bregman divergence, and use them to improve the state-of-the-art in robustness through adversarial training for common image corruptions. In particular, for the contrast corruption that was found problematic in prior work we achieve an accuracy that exceeds the $L^p$- and the LPIPS-based adversarially trained neural networks by a margin of 27.16\% on the CIFAR-10-C corruption data set.</p>
