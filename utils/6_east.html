                        <p><p>In our study, we explore methods for detecting unwanted content lurking in visual datasets. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a model capable of successfully partitioning visual data can be obtained using only textual data. Based on the analysis, we propose Hassle-Free Textual Training (HFTT), a streamlined method capable of acquiring detectors for unwanted visual content, using only textual data in conjunction with pre-trained vision-language models. HFTT features an innovative objective function that significantly reduces the necessity for human involvement in data annotation. Furthermore, HFTT employs a clever textual data synthesis method, effectively emulating the integration of unknown visual data distribution into the training process at no extra cost. The unique characteristics of HFTT extend its utility beyond traditional out-of-distribution detection, making it applicable to tasks that address more abstract concepts. We complement our analyses with experiments in hateful image detection and out-of-distribution detection. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HFTT-anonymous/HFTT.</p>

We propose idiographic personality Gaussian process (IPGP), an intermediate model that accommodates both shared trait structure across individuals and "idiographic" deviations. IPGP leverages the Gaussian process coregionalization model to conceptualize responses of grouped survey batteries but adjusted to non-Gaussian ordinal data, and exploits stochastic variational inference for latent factor estimation. Using both synthetic data and a novel survey, we show that IPGP improves both prediction of actual responses and estimation of intrapersonal response patterns compared to existing benchmarks. In the survey study, IPGP also identifies unique clusters of personality taxonomies, displaying great potential in advancing individualized approaches to psychological diagnosis.</p>

                        <p><p>The rapid advancement of single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) technologies holds great promise for investigating the heterogeneity of epigenetic landscapes at the cellular level. The amplification process in scATAC-seq experiments often introduces noise due to dropout events, which results in extreme sparsity that hinders accurate analysis. Consequently, there is a significant demand for the generation of high-quality scATAC-seq data in silico. Furthermore, current methodologies are typically task-specific, lacking a versatile framework capable of handling multiple tasks within a single model. In this work, we propose ATAC-Diff, a versatile framework, which is based on a diffusion model conditioned on the latent auxiliary variables to adapt for various tasks. ATAC-Diff is the first diffusion model for the scATAC-seq data generation and analysis, composed of auxiliary modules encoding the latent high-level variables to enable the model to learn the semantic information to sample high-quality data. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the latent prior and auxiliary decoder, the yield variables reserve the refined genomic information beneficial for downstream analyses. Another innovation is the incorporation of mutual information between observed and hidden variables as a regularization term to prevent the model from decoupling from latent variables. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ATAC-Diff achieves high performance in both generation and analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models.</p>

                        <p><p>The proliferation of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data presents numerous opportunities for various applications within power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. However, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications is challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is susceptible to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM for ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures temporal dependencies within ETS data, taking into account exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models correlations between different levels of hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pre-training framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning. This framework enables PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments span five real-world scenario datasets, including both private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTAperformance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Notably, when transferred to public datasets, PowerPM retains its edge, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies and few-shot experiments further substantiate the effectiveness of our model.</p>

                        <p><p>Iteratively improving and repairing source code with large language models (LLMs), known as refinement, has emerged as a popular way of generating programs that would be too complex to construct in one shot. Given a bank of test cases, together with a candidate program, an LLM can improve that program by being prompted with failed test cases. But it remains an open question how to best iteratively refine code, with prior work employing simple greedy or breadth-first strategies. We show here that refinement exposes an explore-exploit tradeoff: exploit by refining the program that passes the most test cases, or explore by refining a lesser considered program. We frame this as an arm-acquiring bandit problem, which we solve with Thompson Sampling. The resulting LLM-based program synthesis algorithm is broadly applicable: Across loop invariant synthesis, visual reasoning puzzles, and competition programming problems, we find that our new method can solve more problems using fewer language model calls.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper introduces AutoSurvey, a speedy and well-organized methodology for automating the creation of comprehensive literature surveys in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence. Traditional survey paper creation faces challenges due to the vast volume and complexity of information, prompting the need for efficient survey methods. While large language models (LLMs) offer promise in automating this process, challenges such as context window limitations, parametric knowledge constraints, and the lack of evaluation benchmarks remain. AutoSurvey addresses these challenges through a systematic approach that involves initial retrieval and outline generation, subsection drafting by specialized LLMs, integration and refinement, and rigorous evaluation and iteration. Our contributions include a comprehensive solution to the survey problem, a reliable evaluation method, and experimental validation demonstrating AutoSurvey's effectiveness.</p>

                        <p>Foundation models are becoming valuable tools in medicine. Yet despite their promise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex medical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent framework, named **M**edical **D**ecision-making **Agents** (**MDAgents**) that helps to address this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of LLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the medical task at hand, a simple emulation inspired by the way real-world medical decision-making processes are adapted to tasks of different complexities. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world medical knowledge and clinical diagnosis benchmarks, including a comparison ofLLMs’ medical complexity classification against human physicians. MDAgents achieved the **best performance in seven out of ten** benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant **improvement of up to 4.2\%** ($p$ < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks. Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy **improvement of 11.8\%**.

In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively.Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery.The source code for Retrieval-Retro is available at https://github.com/HeewoongNoh/Retrieval-Retro.</p>

                        <p><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have been increasingly adopted as simulation tools to model humans in social science and role-playing applications. However, one fundamental question remains: can LLM agents really simulate human behavior? In this paper, we focus on one critical and elemental behavior in human interactions, trust, and investigate whether LLM agents can simulate human trust behavior. We first find that LLM agents generally exhibit trust behavior, referred to as agent trust, under the framework of Trust Games, which are widely recognized in behavioral economics. Then, we discover that GPT-4 agents manifest high behavioral alignment with humans in terms of trust behavior, indicating the feasibility of simulating human trust behavior with LLM agents. In addition,  we probe the biases of agent trust and  differences in agent trust towards other LLM agents and humans. We also explore the intrinsic properties of agent trust under conditions including external manipulations and advanced reasoning strategies. Our study provides new insights into the behaviors of LLM agents and the fundamental analogy between LLMs and humans beyond value alignment. We further illustrate broader implications of our discoveries for applications where trust is paramount.</p>

However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications.Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training.This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT.It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models.The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object.All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks.

Current machine learning methods, however, struggle to solve Olympiad-level problems beyond Euclidean plane geometry due to a lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The challenge is even greater in algebraic systems, which involves infinite reasoning spaces within finite conditions. To address these issues, we propose \textit{AIPS}, an \textit{Algebraic Inequality Proving System} capable of autonomously generating complex inequality theorems and effectively solving Olympiad-level inequality problems without requiring human demonstrations. During proof search in a mixed reasoning manner, a value curriculum learning strategy on generated datasets is implemented to improve proving performance, demonstrating strong mathematical intuitions. On a test set of 20 International Mathematical Olympiad-level inequality problems, AIPS successfully solved 10, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AIPS automatically generated a vast array of non-trivial theorems without human intervention, some of which have been evaluated by professional contestants and deemed to reach the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad. Notably, one theorem was selected as a competition problem in a major city 2024 Mathematical Olympiad.All the materials are available at {\it \href{https://sites.google.com/view/aips}{sites.google.com/view/aips}}.</p>

                        <p>Large language models have the ability to generate text that mimics patterns in their inputs. We introduce a simple Markov Chain sequence modeling task in order to study how this in-context learning capability emerges. In our setting, each example is sampled from a Markov chain drawn from a prior distribution over Markov chains. Transformers trained on this task form \emph{statistical induction heads} which compute accurate next-token probabilities given the bigram statistics of the context. During the course of training, models pass through multiple phases: after an initial stage in which predictions are uniform, they learn to sub-optimally predict using in-context single-token statistics (unigrams); then, there is a rapid phase transition to the correct in-context bigram solution. We conduct an empirical and theoretical investigation of this multi-phase process, showing how successful learning results from the interaction between the transformer's layers, and uncovering evidence that the presence of the simpler unigram solution may delay formation of the final bigram solution. We examine how learning is affected by varying the prior distribution over Markov chains, and consider the generalization of our in-context learning of Markov chains (ICL-MC) task to $n$-grams for $n > 2$.</p>

                        <p><p>Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications. In certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant serving, deploying multiple LLMs becomes necessary to meet complex demands. Recent studies suggest decomposing a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are then compressed using low-rank or low-bit approaches to reduce costs. In this work, we observe that existing low-rank and low-bit compression methods can significantly harm the model performance for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., WizardMath for math problems). Motivated by the long-tail distribution of singular values in the delta weights, we propose a delta quantization approach using mixed-precision. This method employs higher-bit representation for singular vectors corresponding to larger singular values. We evaluate our approach on various fine-tuned LLMs, including math LLMs, code LLMs, chat LLMs, and even VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to full fine-tuned LLMs, surpassing both low-rank and low-bit baselines by a considerable margin. Additionally, we show that our method is compatible with various backbone LLMs, such as Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral, highlighting its generalizability.</p>

                        <p><p>In the realm of big data and digital healthcare, Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become a rich source of information with the potential to improve patient care and medical research. In recent years, machine learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients' future health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the vast joint search space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we employ surrogate model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover the optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AutoDP framework. It achieves significant performance improvements over both hand-crafted and automated state-of-the-art methods, also maintains a feasible search cost at the same time.</p>

                        <p><p>Automated seizure detection (ASD) using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is critical for effective epilepsy treatment. However, the significant domain shift of iEEG signals across subjects poses a major challenge, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the primary cause behind the failure of existing iEEG models for subject-independent seizure detection, and identify a critical universal seizure pattern: seizure events consistently exhibit higher average amplitude compared to adjacent normal events. To mitigate the domain shifts and preserve the universal seizure patterns, we propose a novel self-comparison mechanism. This mechanism effectively aligns iEEG signals across subjects and time intervals. Building upon these findings, we propose Difference Matrix-based Neural Network (DMNet), a subject-independent seizure detection model, which leverages self-comparison based on two constructed (contextual, channel-level) references to mitigate shifts of iEEG, and utilize a simple yet effective difference matrix to encode the universal seizure patterns. Extensive experiments show that DMNet significantly outperforms previous SOTAs while maintaining high efficiency on a real-world clinical dataset collected by us and two public datasets for subject-independent seizure detection. Moreover, the visualization results demonstrate that the generated difference matrix can effectively capture the seizure activity changes during the seizure evolution process. Additionally, we deploy our method in an online diagnosis system to illustrate its effectiveness in real clinical applications.</p>

However, accuracies of computational methods in various tasks of Nanopore sequencing data analysis are far from satisfactory. For instance, the base calling accuracy of Nanopore RNA sequencing is $\sim$90\%, while the aim is $\sim$99.9\%. This highlights an urgent need of contributions from the machine learning community. A bottleneck that prevents machine learning researchers from entering this field is the lack of a large integrated benchmark dataset. To this end, we present NanoBaseLib, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark dataset. It integrates 16 public datasets with over 30 million reads for four critical tasks in Nanopore data analysis. To facilitate method development, we have preprocessed all the raw data using a uniform workflow, stored all the intermediate results in uniform formats, analysed test datasets with various baseline methods for four benchmark tasks, and developed a software package to easily access these results.

                        <p><p>Foundation models have made significant strides in understanding the genomic language of DNA sequences. However, previous models typically adopt the tokenization methods designed for natural language, which are unsuitable for DNA sequences due to their unique characteristics. In addition, the optimal approach to tokenize DNA remains largely under-explored, and may not be intuitively understood by humans even if discovered. To address these challenges, we introduce MxDNA, a novel framework where the model autonomously learns an effective DNA tokenization strategy through gradient decent. MxDNA employs a sparse Mixture of Convolution Experts coupled with a deformable convolution to model the tokenization process, with the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of meaningful genomic segments explicitly considered. On Nucleotide Transformer Benchmarks and Genomic Benchmarks, MxDNA demonstrates superior performance to existing methods with less pretraining data and time, highlighting its effectiveness. Finally, we show that MxDNA learns unique tokenization strategy distinct to those of previous methods and captures genomic functionalities at a token level during self-supervised pretraining. Our MxDNA aims to provide a new perspective on DNA tokenization, potentially offering broad applications in various domains and yielding profound insights.

                        <p><p>The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retraining for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems.Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</p>

Metagenomic binning, for instance, relies on genome representations to cluster complex mixtures of DNA fragments from biological samples with the aim of determining their microbial compositions. In this paper, we revisit k-mer-based representations of genomes and provide a theoretical analysis of their use in representation learning. Based on the analysis, we propose a lightweight and scalable model for performing metagenomic binning at the genome read level, relying only on the k-mer compositions of the DNA fragments. We compare the model to recent genome foundation models and demonstrate that while the models are comparable in performance, the proposed model is significantly more effective in terms of scalability, a crucial aspect for performing metagenomic binning of real-world data sets.</p>

                        <p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an experimental technique for protein structure determination that images an ensemble of macromolecules in near-physiological contexts. While recent advances enable the reconstruction of dynamic conformations of a single biomolecular complex, current methods do not adequately model samples with mixed conformational and compositional heterogeneity. In particular, datasets containing mixtures of multiple proteins require the joint inference of structure, pose, compositional class, and conformational states for 3D reconstruction. Here, we present Hydra, an approach that models both conformational and compositional heterogeneity fully ab initio by parameterizing structures as arising from one of K neural fields. We employ a hybrid optimization strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets composed of mixtures of proteins with large degrees of conformational variability. We additionally demonstrate Hydra on an experimental dataset imaged of a cellular lysate containing a mixture of different protein complexes. Hydra expands the expressivity of heterogeneous reconstruction methods and thus broadens the scope of cryo-EM to increasingly complex samples.</p>

However, experimental platforms for aptamer screening are costly, and the scarcity of labeled data presents a challenge for supervised methods to learn protein-aptamer binding. To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement. Moreover, we curate five real-world protein-aptamer interaction datasets and show that the contact map predicted by FAFormer serves as a strong binding indicator for aptamer screening.</p>

Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is crucial in resolving near-atomic resolution 3D structures of proteins, such as the SARS-COV-2 spike protein. To achieve high-resolution reconstruction, a comprehensive data processing pipeline has been adopted. However, its performance is still limited as it lacks high-quality annotated datasets for training. To address this, we introduce physics-informed generative cryo-electron microscopy (CryoGEM), which for the first time integrates physics-based cryo-EM simulation with a generative unpaired noise translation to generate physically correct synthetic cryo-EM datasets with realistic noises. Initially, CryoGEM simulates the cryo-EM imaging process based on a virtual specimen. To generate realistic noises, we leverage an unpaired noise translation via contrastive learning with a novel mask-guided sampling scheme. Extensive experiments show that CryoGEM is capable of generating authentic cryo-EM images. The generated dataset can be used as training data for particle picking and pose estimation models, eventually improving the reconstruction resolution.</p>

                        <p><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been an efficient approach to transferring the semantic segmentation model across data distributions. Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p>

                        <p><p>Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) streaming is a challenging problem, which is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy realtime constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If acheived, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g., 3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at ~350 FPS.</p>

                        <p><p>Creating realistic avatars from a single RGB image is an attractive yet challenging problem. To deal with challenging loose clothing or occlusion by interaction objects, we leverage powerful shape prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human-3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other. By coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models. We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the prior from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guides the 2D reverse sampling processto have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance. Extensive ablations also validate the efficacy of our design, (1) multi-view 2D priors conditioning in generative 3D reconstruction and (2) consistency refinement of sampling trajectory via the explicit 3D representation.

                        <p><p>Inter-frame modeling is pivotal in generating intermediate frames for video frame interpolation (VFI). Current approaches predominantly rely on convolution or attention-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. Recently, Selective State Space Models (S6) have emerged, tailored specifically for long sequence modeling, offering both linear complexity and data-dependent modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose VFIMamba, a novel frame interpolation method for efficient and dynamic inter-frame modeling by harnessing the S6 model. Our approach introduces the Mixed-SSM Block (MSB), which initially rearranges tokens from adjacent frames in an interleaved fashion and subsequently applies multi-directional S6 modeling. This design facilitates the efficient transmission of information across frames while upholding linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy that progressively cultivates proficiency in modeling inter-frame dynamics across varying motion magnitudes, fully unleashing the potential of the S6 model. Experimental findings showcase that our method attains state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, particularly excelling in high-resolution scenarios. In particular, on the X-TEST dataset, VFIMamba demonstrates a noteworthy improvement of 0.80 dB for 4K frames and 0.96 dB for 2K frames.</p>

Existing offboard methods focus on 3D object detection with closed-set taxonomy and fail to match human-level recognition capability on the rapidly evolving perception tasks. Due to heavy reliance on human labels and the prevalence of data imbalance and sparsity, a unified framework for offboard auto-labeling various elements in AD scenes that meets the distinct needs of perception tasks is not being fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal Zero-shot Offboard Panoptic Perception (ZOPP) framework for autonomous driving scenes. ZOPP integrates the powerful zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision foundation models and 3D representations derived from point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, ZOPP represents a pioneering effort in the domain of multi-modal panoptic perception and auto labeling for autonomous driving scenes. We conduct comprehensive empirical studies and evaluations on Waymo open dataset to validate the proposed ZOPP on various perception tasks. To further explore the usability and extensibility of our proposed ZOPP, we also conduct experiments in downstream applications. The results further demonstrate the great potential of our ZOPP for real-world scenarios. Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/ZOPP}.</p>

It is a challenging and fundamental combinatorial optimization problem in integrated circuit design. Traditional LS approaches rely on manually designed heuristics to tackle the LS task, while machine learning recently offers a promising approach towards next-generation logic synthesis by neural circuit generation and optimization. In this paper, we first revisit the application of differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) methods to circuit generation and found from extensive experiments that existing DNAS methods struggle to exactly generate circuits, scale poorly to large circuits, and exhibit high sensitivity to hyper-parameters. Then we provide three major insights for these challenges from extensive empirical analysis: 1) DNAS tends to overfit to too many skip-connections, consequently wasting a significant portion of the network's expressive capabilities; 2) DNAS suffers from the structure bias between the network architecture and the circuit inherent structure, leading to inefficient search; 3) the learning difficulty of different input-output examples varies significantly, leading to severely imbalanced learning. To address these challenges in a systematic way, we propose a novel regularized triangle-shaped circuit network generation framework, which leverages our key insights for completely accurate and scalable circuit generation. Furthermore, we propose an evolutionary algorithm assisted by reinforcement learning agent restarting technique for efficient and effective neural circuit optimization. Extensive experiments on four different circuit benchmarks demonstrate that our method can precisely generate circuits with up to 1200 nodes. Moreover, our synthesized circuits significantly outperform the state-of-the-art results from several competitive winners in IWLS 2022 and 2023 competitions.</p>

                        <p>State-of-the-art image restoration methods currently face challenges in terms of computational requirements and performance, making them impractical for deployment on edge devices such as phones and resource-limited devices. As a result, there is a need to develop alternative solutions with efficient designs that can achieve comparable performance to transformer or large-kernel methods. This motivates our research to explore techniques for improving the capability of small-size image restoration standing on the success secret of large receptive filed.Targeting at expanding receptive filed, spatial-shift operator tailored for efficient spatial communication and  has achieved remarkable advances in high-level image classification tasks, like $S^2$-MLP and ShiftVit. However, its potential has rarely been explored in low-level image restoration tasks. The underlying reason behind this obstacle is that image restoration is sensitive to the spatial shift that occurs due to severe region-aware information loss, which exhibits a different behavior from high-level tasks. To address this challenge and unleash the potential of spatial shift for image restoration, we propose an information-lossless shifting operator, i.e., Deep Fourier Shifting, that is customized for image restoration. To develop our proposed operator, we first revisit the principle of shift operator and apply it to the Fourier domain, where the shift operator can be modeled in an information-lossless Fourier cycling manner. Inspired by Fourier cycling, we design two variants of Deep Fourier Shifting, namely the amplitude-phase variant and the real-imaginary variant. These variants are generic operators that can be directly plugged into existing image restoration networks as a drop-in replacement for the standard convolution unit, consuming fewer parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple low-level tasks including image denoising, low-light image enhancement, guided image super-resolution, and image de-blurring demonstrate consistent performance gains obtained by our Deep Fourier Shifting while reducing the computation burden. Additionally, ablation studies verify the robustness of the shift displacement with stable performance improvement.</p>

To overcome the overfitting problem of existing work for these real-world videos, we introduce an uncertainty-aware regularization that identifies uncertain regions with few observations and selectively imposes additional priors based on diffusion models and depth smoothness on such regions.This approach improves both the performance of novel view synthesis and the quality of training image reconstruction. We also identify the initialization problem of 4DGS in fast-moving dynamic regions, where the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm fails to provide reliable 3D landmarks. To initialize Gaussian primitives in such regions, we present a dynamic region densification method using the estimated depth maps and scene flow. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves the performance of 4DGS reconstruction from a video captured by a handheld monocular camera and also exhibits promising results in few-shot static scene reconstruction.</p>

                        <p><p>Our objective in this paper is to probe large vision models to determine to what extent they ‘understand’ different physical properties of the 3D scene depicted in an image. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We introduce a general and lightweight protocol to evaluate whether features of an off-the-shelf large vision model encode a number of physical ‘properties’ of the 3D scene, by training discriminative classifiers on the features for these properties. The probes are applied on datasets of real images with annotations for the property. (ii) We apply this protocol to properties covering scene geometry, scene material, support relations, lighting, and view-dependent measures, and large vision models including CLIP, DINOv1, DINOv2, VQGAN, Stable Diffusion. (iii) We find that features from Stable Diffusion and DINOv2 are good for discriminative learning of a number of properties, including scene geometry, support relations, shadows and depth, but less performant for occlusion and material, while outperforming DINOv1, CLIP and VQGAN for all properties. (iv) It is observed that different time steps of Stable Diffusion features, as well as different transformer layers of DINO/CLIP/VQGAN, are good at different properties, unlocking potential applications of 3D physical understanding.</p>

                        <p><p>Semantic scene completion is a difficult task that involves completing the geometry and semantics of a scene from point clouds in a large-scale environment. Many current methods use 3D/2D convolutions or attention mechanisms, but these have limitations in directly constructing geometry and accurately propagating features from related voxels, the completion likely fails while propagating features in a single pass without considering multiple potential pathways. And they are generally only suitable for static scenes and struggle to handle dynamic aspects. This paper introduces Voxel Proposal Network (VPNet) that completes scenes from 3D and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perspectives. It includes Confident Voxel Proposal based on voxel-wise coordinates to propose confident voxels with high reliability for completion. This method reconstructs the scene geometry and implicitly models the uncertainty of voxel-wise semantic labels by presenting multiple possibilities for voxels. VPNet employs Multi-Frame Knowledge Distillation based on the point clouds of multiple adjacent frames to accurately predict the voxel-wise labels by condensing various possibilities of voxel relationships. VPNet has shown superior performance and achieved state-of-the-art results on the SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS datasets.</p>

                        <p><p>Human visual abilities are a common inspiration for computer vision algorithms. Here we introduce a benchmark to directly evaluate the alignment between human observers and vision models on 3D shape inferences. Our experimental design requires zero-shot visual inferences about object shape: given three images, participants identify which contain the same/different objects, in spite of considerable viewpoint variation. Images in this dataset include common objects (e.g., chairs) as well as abstract shapes (i.e., synthetic objects without semantic attributes), while controlling for a number of shape-orthogonal image properties (e.g., lighting, background). After constructing over 2000 unique image triplets, we administer these tasks to human participants, collecting 35K trials of behavioral data from over 500 participants. With these data, we define a series of increasingly granular evaluation metrics using choice, reaction time, and eye-tracking measurements. We evaluate models optimized via contrastive (DINOv2) and masked autoencoding (MAE) self-supervision objectives, as well as language-image pretraining (CLIP). While there are underlying similarities between human and model choice behaviors, humans outperform all models by a wide margin, typically succeeding where models fail. Using more granular evaluation metrics from reaction time and gaze data, we conclude by identifying potential sources for this divergence. This benchmark is designed to serve as an independent validation set, showcasing the utility of a multiscale approach to evaluating human-model alignment on 3D shape inferences.</p>

                        <p><p>Fitness functions map large combinatorial spaces of biological sequences to properties of interest. Inferring these multimodal functions from experimental data is a central task in modern protein engineering. Global epistasis models are an effective and physically-grounded class of models for estimating fitness functions from observed data. These models assume that a sparse latent function is transformed by a monotonic nonlinearity to emit measurable fitness. Here we demonstrate that minimizing supervised contrastive loss functions, such as the Bradley-Terry loss, is a simple and flexible technique for extracting the sparse latent function implied by global epistasis. We argue by way of a fitness-epistasis uncertainty principle that the nonlinearities in global epistasis models can produce observed fitness functions that do not admit sparse representations, and thus may be inefficient to learn from observations when using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss (a common practice). We show that contrastive losses are able to accurately estimate a ranking function from limited data even in regimes where MSE is ineffective and validate the practical utility of this insight by demonstrating that contrastive loss functions result in consistently improved performance on empirical benchmark tasks.</p>

                        <p>Visual foundation models have achieved remarkable results in zero-shot image classification and segmentation, but zero-shot change detection remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose the segment any change models (AnyChange), a new type of change detection model that supports zero-shot prediction and generalization on unseen change types and data distributions.AnyChange is built on the segment anything model (SAM) via our training-free adaptation method, bitemporal latent matching.By revealing and exploiting intra-image and inter-image semantic similarities in SAM's latent space, bitemporal latent matching endows SAM with zero-shot change detection capabilities in a training-free way. We also propose a point query mechanism to enable AnyChange's zero-shot object-centric change detection capability.We perform extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of AnyChange for zero-shot change detection.AnyChange sets a new record on the SECOND benchmark for unsupervised change detection, exceeding the previous SOTA by up to 4.4\% F$_1$ score, and achieving comparable accuracy with negligible manual annotations (1 pixel per image) for supervised change detection.

                        <p><p>Lane detection is an important yet challenging task in autonomous driving systems. Existing lane detection methods mainly rely on finer-scale information to identify key points of lane lines. Since local information in realistic road environments is frequently obscured by other vehicles or affected by poor outdoor lighting conditions, these methods struggle with the regression of such key points. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Transformer with hierarchical refinement for lane detection to improve the detection accuracy in complex road environments. Specifically, we propose a high-to-low hierarchical refinement Transformer structure, called LAne TRansformer (LATR), to refine the key points of lane lines, which integrates global semantics information and finer-scale features. Moreover, exploiting the thin and long characteristics of lane lines, we propose a novel Curve-IoU loss to supervise the fit of lane lines. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of lane detection demonstrate that our proposed new method achieves state-of-the-art results with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves improved F1 scores on the OpenLane dataset, surpassing the current best-performing method by 5.0 points.</p>

                        <p><p>Object pose estimation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation, however, its practical applicability still suffers from limited generalizability. This paper addresses the challenge of generalizable object pose estimation, particularly focusing on category-level object pose estimation for unseen object categories. Current methods either require impractical instance-level training or are confined to predefined categories, limiting their applicability. We propose VFM-6D, a novel framework that explores harnessing existing vision and language models, to elaborate object pose estimation into two stages: category-level object viewpoint estimation and object coordinate map estimation. Based on the two-stage framework, we introduce a 2D-to-3D feature lifting module and a shape-matching module, both of which leverage pre-trained vision foundation models to improve object representation and matching accuracy. VFM-6D is trained on cost-effective synthetic data and exhibits superior generalization capabilities. It can be applied to both instance-level unseen object pose estimation and category-level object pose estimation for novel categories. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of VFM-6D in various real-world scenarios.</p>

                        <p>The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into $K$ blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DoGaussian maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and $K$ local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The $K$ local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by $6+$ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

Recent models, however, face difficulties in maintaining high performance when applied to domains with differing sensor setups or geographic locations, often resulting in poor localization accuracy due to domain shift. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion-based box refinement approach. This method employs a domain-agnostic diffusion model, conditioned on the LiDAR points surrounding a coarse bounding box, to simultaneously refine the box's location, size, and orientation. We evaluate this approach under various domain adaptation settings, and our results reveal significant improvements across different datasets, object classes and detectors.

                        <p><p>Human visual search ability enables efficient and accurate tracking of an arbitrary moving target, which is a significant research interest in cognitive neuroscience. The recently proposed Central-Peripheral Dichotomy (CPD) theory sheds light on how humans effectively process visual information and track moving targets in complex environments. However, existing visual object tracking algorithms still fall short of matching human performance in maintaining tracking over time, particularly in complex scenarios requiring robust visual search skills. These scenarios often involve Spatio-Temporal Discontinuities (i.e., STDChallenge), prevalent in long-term tracking and global instance tracking. To address this issue, we conduct research from a human-like modeling perspective: (1) Inspired by the CPD, we pro- pose a new tracker named CPDTrack to achieve human-like visual search ability. The central vision of CPDTrack leverages the spatio-temporal continuity of videos to introduce priors and enhance localization precision, while the peripheral vision improves global awareness and detects object movements. (2) To further evaluate and analyze STDChallenge, we create the STDChallenge Benchmark. Besides, by incorporating human subjects, we establish a human baseline, creating a high- quality environment specifically designed to assess trackers’ visual search abilities in videos across STDChallenge. (3) Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CPDTrack not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in this challenge but also narrows the behavioral differences with humans. Additionally, CPDTrack exhibits strong generalizability across various challenging benchmarks. In summary, our research underscores the importance of human-like modeling and offers strategic insights for advancing intelligent visual target tracking.

                        <p><p>With the continuous evolution of AI-generated images, the generalized detection of them has become a crucial aspect of AI security. Existing detectors have focused on cross-generator generalization, while it remains unexplored whether these detectors can generalize across different image scenes, e.g., images from different datasets with different semantics. In this paper, we reveal that existing detectors suffer from substantial Accuracy drops in such cross-scene generalization. In particular, we attribute their failures to ''semantic artifacts'' in both real and generated images, to which detectors may overfit. To break such ''semantic artifacts'', we propose a simple yet effective approach based on conducting an image patch shuffle and then training an end-to-end patch-based classifier. We conduct a comprehensive open-world evaluation on 31 test sets, covering 7 Generative Adversarial Networks, 18 (variants of) Diffusion Models, and another 6 CNN-based generative models. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous approaches by 2.08\% (absolute) on average regarding cross-scene detection Accuracy. We also notice the superiority of our approach in open-world generalization, with an average Accuracy improvement of 10.59\% (absolute) across all test sets.</p>

                        <p><p>Generating high-quality 3D assets from text and images has long been challenging, primarily due to the absence of scalable 3D representations capable of capturing intricate geometry distributions. In this work, we introduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input images, without requiring a multi-view diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our approach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder (D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently encodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane space. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a semi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods relying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the distribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse positional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent, enabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets. Additionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline incorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to produce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale pre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving significantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

                        <p><p>Neural 3D scene representations have shown great potential for 3D reconstruction from 2D images. However, reconstructing real-world captures of complex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not adequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that explicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed reflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we observe that these methods are often not robust in real scenarios where non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this work, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can reconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both camera view as well as reflected view-based color parameterization techniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space enables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate, especially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with a multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on object-level datasets DTU, Shiny Blender as well as unbounded datasets Mip-NeRF 360 and Ref-NeRF real demonstrate that our method is able to robustly reconstruct complex large-scale scenes with fine details and reflective surfaces, leading to the best overall performance.

                        <p><p>Despite advancements in Neural Implicit models for 3D surface reconstruction, handling dynamic environments with interactions between arbitrary rigid, non-rigid, or deformable entities remains challenging. The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions,although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improvedtraining efficiency compared to existing methods.

However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</p>

                        <p><p>Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges due to data heterogeneity across distributed clients. To address this, we propose FedGMKD, a novel framework that combines knowledge distillation and differential aggregation for efficient prototype-based personalized FL without the need for public datasets or server-side generative models. FedGMKD introduces Cluster Knowledge Fusion, utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models to generate prototype features and soft predictions on the client side, enabling effective knowledge distillation while preserving data privacy. Additionally, we implement a Discrepancy-Aware Aggregation Technique that weights client contributions based on data quality and quantity, enhancing the global model's generalization across diverse client distributions. Theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of FedGMKD. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that FedGMKD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving both local and global accuracy in non-IID data settings.</p>

                        <p><p>Forecasting a typical object's future motion is a critical task for interpreting and interacting with dynamic environments in computer vision. Event-based sensors, which could capture changes in the scene with exceptional temporal granularity, may potentially offer a unique opportunity to predict future motion with a level of detail and precision previously unachievable. Inspired by that, we propose to integrate the strong learning capacity of the video diffusion model with the rich motion information of an event camera as a motion simulation framework. Specifically, we initially employ pre-trained stable video diffusion models to adapt the event sequence dataset. This process facilitates the transfer of extensive knowledge from RGB videos to an event-centric domain. Moreover, we introduce an alignment mechanism that utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the reverse generation trajectory of the diffusion model, ensuring improved performance and accuracy. Through extensive testing and validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various complex scenarios, showcasing its potential to revolutionize motion flow prediction in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicle guidance, robotic navigation, and interactive media. Our findings suggest a promising direction for future research in enhancing the interpretative power and predictive accuracy of computer vision systems.

                        <p><p>Visual Grounding aims to localize the referring object in an image given a natural language expression. Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding methods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the coordinates of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as pre-generated proposal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However, existing research primarily focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder, which typically generates learnable queries by random initialization or by using linguistic embeddings.  This vanilla query generation approach inevitably increases the learning difficulty for the model, as it does not involve any target-related information at the beginning of decoding. Furthermore, they only use the deepest image feature during the query learning process, overlooking the importance of features from other levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer. It consists of the query adaption module that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP and generate the referential query to provide the prior context for decoder, along with a task-specific decoder. By incorporating the referential query into the decoder, we can effectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder, and accurately concentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query adaption module can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within CLIP without the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on five visual grounding benchmarks.</p>

It iteratively optimizes the image by leveraging pre-trained weights, focusing on alternate reconstruction of different image parts, and gradually assembles fully denoised image within limited number of iterations.Comprehensive experiments across various noisy scenarios underscore the notable advances of MPI over previous approaches with a marked reduction in inference time.</p>

The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses.Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction.The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric.Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation.We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF).

While existing deep learning models have shown promising results, few have fully embedded Retinex theory into their architecture, highlighting a gap in current methodologies. Additionally, the balance between high performance and efficiency remains an under-explored problem for exposure correction task. Inspired by Mamba which demonstrates powerful and highly efficient sequence modeling, we introduce a novel framework based on \textbf{Mamba} for \textbf{E}xposure \textbf{C}orrection (\textbf{ECMamba}) with dual pathways, each dedicated to the restoration of reflectance and illumination map, respectively. Specifically, we firstly derive the Retinex theory and we train a Retinex estimator capable of mapping inputs into two intermediary spaces, each approximating the target reflectance and illumination map, respectively. This setup facilitates the refined restoration process of the subsequent \textbf{E}xposure \textbf{C}orrection \textbf{M}amba \textbf{M}odule (\textbf{ECMM}). Moreover, we develop a novel \textbf{2D S}elective \textbf{S}tate-space layer guided by \textbf{Retinex} information (\textbf{Retinex-SS2D}) as the core operator of \textbf{ECMM}. This architecture incorporates an innovative 2D scanning strategy based on deformable feature aggregation, thereby enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness.

                        <p><p>Pedestrian pre-collision pose is one of the key factors to determine the degree of pedestrian-vehicle injury in collision. Human pose estimation algorithm is an effective method to estimate pedestrian emergency pose from accident video. However, the pose estimation model trained by the existing daily human pose datasets has poor robustness under specific poses such as pedestrian pre-collision pose, and it is difficult to obtain human pose datasets in the wild scenes, especially lacking scarce data such as pedestrian pre-collision pose in traffic scenes. In this paper, we collect pedestrian-vehicle collision pose from the dashcam perspective of dashcam and construct the first Pedestrian-Vehicle Collision Pose dataset (PVCP) in a semi-automatic way, including 40k+ accident frames and 20K+ pedestrian pre-collision pose annotation (2D, 3D, Mesh). Further, we construct a Pedestrian Pre-collision Pose Estimation Network (PPSENet) to estimate the collision pose and shape sequence of pedestrians from pedestrian-vehicle accident videos. The PPSENet first estimates the 2D pose from the image (Image to Pose, ITP) and then lifts the 2D pose to 3D mesh (Pose to Mesh, PTM). Due to the small size of the dataset, we introduce a pre-training model that learns the human pose prior on a large number of pose datasets, and use iterative regression to estimate the pre-collision pose and shape of pedestrians. Further, we classify the pre-collision pose sequence and introduce pose class loss, which achieves the best accuracy compared with the existing relevant \textit{state-of-the-art} methods.

                        <p><p>We present DC-Gaussian, a new method for generating novel views from in-vehicle dash cam videos. While neural rendering techniques have made significant strides in driving scenarios, existing methods are primarily designed for videos collected by autonomous vehicles. However, these videos are limited in both quantity and diversity compared to dash cam videos, which are more widely used across various types of vehicles and capture a broader range of scenarios. Dash cam videos often suffer from severe obstructions such as reflections and occlusions on the windshields, which significantly impede the application of neural rendering techniques. To address this challenge, we develop DC-Gaussian based on the recent real-time neural rendering technique 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach includes an adaptive image decomposition module to model reflections and occlusions in a unified manner. Additionally, we introduce illumination-aware obstruction modeling to manage reflections and occlusions under varying lighting conditions. Lastly, we employ a geometry-guided Gaussian enhancement strategy to improve rendering details by incorporating additional geometry priors. Experiments on self-captured and public dash cam videos show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, but also accurately reconstructing captured scenes getting rid of obstructions.</p>

                        <p><p>Domain generalizable person re-identification (DG re-ID) aims to learn discriminative representations that are robust to distributional shifts. While data augmentation is a straightforward solution to improve generalization, certain augmentations exhibit a polarized effect in this task, enhancing in-distribution performance while deteriorating out-of-distribution performance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon and reveal that it leads to sparse representation spaces with reduced uniformity. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Balancing Alignment and Uniformity (BAU), which effectively mitigates this effect by maintaining a balance between alignment and uniformity. Specifically, BAU incorporates alignment and uniformity losses applied to both original and augmented images and integrates a weighting strategy to assess the reliability of augmented samples, further improving the alignment loss. Additionally, we introduce a domain-specific uniformity loss that promotes uniformity within each source domain, thereby enhancing the learning of domain-invariant features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BAU effectively exploits the advantages of data augmentation, which previous studies could not fully utilize, and achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring complex training procedures.</p>

                        <p><p>Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based volume rendering has demonstrated significant capabilities in surface reconstruction. Although promising, SDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures, resulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering to density-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within the SDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representation and geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinder the optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduce NeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that not only achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains the flexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods.   NeuRodin incorporates innovative strategies that facilitate transformation of arbitrary topologies and reduce artifacts associated with density bias.  Extensive evaluations on the Tanks and Temples and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuRodin, showing strong reconstruction capabilities for both indoor and outdoor environments using solely posed RGB captures.

                        <p>Most large multimodal models (LMMs) are implemented by feeding visual tokens as a sequence into the first layer of a large language model (LLM). The resulting architecture is simple but significantly increases computation and memory costs, as it has to handle a large number of additional tokens in its input layer. This paper presents a new architecture *DeepStack* for LMMs. Considering $N$ layers in the language and vision transformer of LMMs, we stack the visual tokens into $N$ groups and feed each group to its aligned transformer layer from bottom to top. Surprisingly, this simple method greatly enhances the power of LMMs to model interactions among visual tokens across layers but with minimal additional cost. We apply *DeepStack* to both language and vision transformer in LMMs, and validate the effectiveness of *DeepStack* LMMs with extensive empirical results. Using the same context length, our DeepStack 7B and 13B parameters surpass their counterparts by 2.7 and 2.9 on average across 9 benchmarks, respectively. Using only one-fifth of the context length, DeepStack rivals closely to the counterparts that use the full context length. These gains are particularly pronounced on high-resolution tasks, *e.g.*, 4.2, 11.0, and 4.0 improvements on TextVQA, DocVQA, and InfoVQA compared to LLaVA-1.5-7B, respectively. We further apply *DeepStack* to vision transformer layers, which brings us a similar amount of improvements, 3.8 on average compared with LLaVA-1.5-7B.</p>

To improve the detection accuracy, we propose an Adaptive Important Region Selection (AIRS) framework guided by Evidential Q-learning coupled with a uniquely designed reward function. Inspired by human visual attention, our detection model conducts object search in a top-down, hierarchical fashion. It starts from the top of the hierarchy with the coarsest granularity and then identifies the potential patches likely to contain objects of interest. It then discards non-informative patches and progressively moves downward on the selected ones for a fine-grained search. The proposed evidential Q-learning systematically encodes epistemic uncertainty in its evidential-Q value to encourage the exploration of unknown patches, especially in the early phase of model training. In this way, the proposed model dynamically balances exploration-exploitation to cover both highly valuable and informative patches. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the SOTA models.</p>

                        <p><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE.</p>

                        <p><p>It is vital to infer a signed distance function (SDF) for multi-view based surface reconstruction. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) provides a novel perspective for volume rendering, and shows advantages in rendering efficiency and quality. Although 3DGS provides a promising neural rendering option, it is still hard to infer SDFs for surface reconstruction with 3DGS due to the discreteness, the sparseness, and the off-surface drift of 3D Gaussians. To resolve these issues, we propose a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the learning of neural SDFs. Our key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF inference with the multi-view consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set of the neural SDF, and then render the aligned 3D Gaussians through the differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by pulling neighboring space to the pulled 3D Gaussians, which progressively refine the signed distance field near the surface. With both differentiable pulling and splatting, we jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB and geometry constraints, which recovers more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with more geometry details. Our numerical and visual comparisons show our superiority over the state-of-the-art results on the widely used benchmarks.</p>

Simultaneously, the current mask visual language modeling (MVLM) fails to capture the nuanced referential relationship between image-text in referring tasks. In this paper, we propose <strong>OneRef</strong>, a minimalist referring framework built on the modality-shared one-tower transformer that unifies the visual and linguistic feature spaces. To modeling the referential relationship, we introduce a novel MVLM paradigm called Mask Referring Modeling (<strong>MRefM</strong>), which encompasses both referring-aware mask image modeling and referring-aware mask language modeling. Both modules not only reconstruct modality-related content but also cross-modal referring content. Within MRefM, we propose a referring-aware dynamic image masking strategy that is aware of the referred region rather than relying on fixed ratios or generic random masking schemes. By leveraging the unified visual language feature space and incorporating MRefM's ability to model the referential relations, our approach enables direct regression of the referring results without resorting to various complex techniques. Our method consistently surpasses existing approaches and achieves SoTA performance on both grounding and segmentation tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

                        <p><p>Vision-language foundation models (such as CLIP) have recently shown their power in transfer learning, owing to large-scale image-text pre-training. However, target domain data in the downstream tasks can be highly different from the pre-training phase, which makes it hard for such a single model to generalize well. Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that contain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different modalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are "isolated agents" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their knowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which transports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and effectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation. With such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous agents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in the inference phase. Finally, our TransAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 visual recognition datasets. Under the same low-shot setting, it outperforms the popular CoOp with around 10\% on average, and 20\% on EuroSAT which contains large domain shifts.</p>

                        <p><p>Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular mathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving the performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality data, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation techniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches do not take into account specific block structures—which are closely related to the problem formulations—in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of MILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or infeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus problem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP generation framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to generate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures. Specifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and decomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks of MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by removing, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances, enabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of MILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational hardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to significantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers.</p>

                        <p><p>Although recent efforts have extended Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) into LiDAR point cloud synthesis, the majority of existing works exhibit a strong dependence on precomputed poses. However, point cloud registration methods struggle to achieve precise global pose estimation, whereas previous pose-free NeRFs overlook geometric consistency in global reconstruction. In light of this, we explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit registration priors for reconstruction. Based on this, we propose Geometry guided Neural LiDAR Fields (GeoNLF), a hybrid framework performing alternately global neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization. Furthermore, NeRFs tend to overfit individual frames and easily get stuck in local minima under sparse-view inputs. To tackle this issue, we develop a selective-reweighting strategy and introduce geometric constraints for robust optimization. Extensive experiments on NuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoNLF in both novel view synthesis and multi-view registration of low-frequency large-scale point clouds.</p>

                        <p><p>We present an efficient neural 3D scene representation for novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale, dynamic urban areas. Existing works are not well suited for applications like mixed-reality or closed-loop simulation due to their limited visual quality and non-interactive rendering speeds. Recently, rasterization-based approaches have achieved high-quality NVS at impressive speeds. However, these methods are limited to small-scale, homogeneous data, i.e. they cannot handle severe appearance and geometry variations due to weather, season, and lighting and do not scale to larger, dynamic areas with thousands of images. We propose 4DGF, a neural scene representation that scales to large-scale dynamic urban areas, handles heterogeneous input data, and substantially improves rendering speeds. We use 3D Gaussians as an efficient geometry scaffold while relying on neural fields as a compact and flexible appearance model. We integrate scene dynamics via a scene graph at global scale while modeling articulated motions on a local level via deformations. This decomposed approach enables flexible scene composition suitable for real-world applications. In experiments, we surpass the state-of-the-art by over 3 dB in PSNR and more than 200x in rendering speed.</p>

                        <p>Incorporating inductive bias by embedding geometric entities (such as rays) as input has proven successful in multi-view learning. However, the methods adopting this technique typically lack equivariance, which is crucial for effective 3D learning. Equivariance serves as a valuable inductive prior, aiding in the generation of robust multi-view features for 3D scene understanding. In this paper, we explore the application of equivariant multi-view learning to depth estimation, not only recognizing its significance for computer vision and robotics but also addressing the limitations of previous research. Most prior studies have either overlooked equivariance in this setting or achieved only approximate equivariance through data augmentation, which often leads to inconsistencies across different reference frames. To address this issue, we propose to embed $SE(3)$ equivariance into the Perceiver IO architecture. We employ Spherical Harmonics for positional encoding to ensure 3D rotation equivariance, and develop a specialized equivariant encoder and decoder within the Perceiver IO architecture. To validate our model, we applied it to the task of stereo depth estimation, achieving state of the art results on real-world datasets without explicit geometric constraints or extensive data augmentation.</p>

                        <p><p>While 3D object bounding box (bbox) representation has been widely used in autonomous driving perception, it lacks the ability to capture the precise details of an object's intrinsic geometry. Recently, occupancy has emerged as a promising alternative for 3D scene perception. However, constructing a high-resolution occupancy map remains infeasible for large scenes due to computational constraints. Recognizing that foreground objects only occupy a small portion of the scene, we introduce object-centric occupancy as a supplement to object bboxes. This representation not only provides intricate details for detected objects but also enables higher voxel resolution in practical applications. We advance the development of object-centric occupancy perception from both data and algorithm perspectives. On the data side, we construct the first object-centric occupancy dataset from scratch using an automated pipeline. From the algorithmic standpoint, we introduce a novel object-centric occupancy completion network equipped with an implicit shape decoder that manages dynamic-size occupancy generation. This network accurately predicts the complete object-centric occupancy volume for inaccurate object proposals by leveraging temporal information from long sequences. Our method demonstrates robust performance in completing object shapes under noisy detection and tracking conditions. Additionally, we show that our occupancy features significantly enhance the detection results of state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, especially for incomplete or distant objects in the Waymo Open Dataset.</p>

While current evaluation of these systems typically assumes fixed working points based on pre-defined rejection thresholds, methodological progress requires benchmarking the general performance of systems akin to the $\mathrm{AUROC}$ in standard classification. In this work, we define 5 requirements for multi-threshold metrics in selective classification regarding task alignment, interpretability, and flexibility, and show how current approaches fail to meet them. We propose the Area under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve ($\mathrm{AUGRC}$), which meets all requirements and can be directly interpreted as the average risk of undetected failures. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of $\mathrm{AUGRC}$ on a comprehensive benchmark spanning 6 data sets and 13 confidence scoring functions. We find that the proposed metric substantially changes metric rankings on 5 out of the 6 data sets.</p>

                        <p><p>In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging task, On-the-fly Category Discovery (OCD), aiming to online discover the newly-coming stream data that belong to both known and unknown classes, by leveraging only known category knowledge contained in labeled data. Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based technique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise inference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space not only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also causes ``high sensitivity'' issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading to inferior performance. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware Prototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to mitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative information contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage projection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category diversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts the discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated category prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By jointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are mutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the significant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g. obtaining an improvement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the nature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying mechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown categories.

                        <p><p>Depth refinement aims to infer high-resolution depth with fine-grained edges and details, refining low-resolution results of depth estimation models. The prevailing methods adopt tile-based manners by merging numerous patches, which lacks efficiency and produces inconsistency. Besides, prior arts suffer from fuzzy depth boundaries and limited generalizability. Analyzing the fundamental reasons for these limitations, we model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem with local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. We propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework to enforce robustness against the noises, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. With noisy depth predictions as input, SDDR generates low-noise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels by coarse-to-fine self-distillation. Edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss serves as the optimization objective equivalent to Poisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the labels also become more noise-free. Our model can acquire strong robustness to the noises, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and generalizability on five different benchmarks. Moreover, directly training another model with edge labels produced by SDDR brings improvements, suggesting that our method could help with training robust refinement models in future works.</p>

                        <p><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) is known for its scalability. In this work, we target to scale down a ViT to fit in an environment with dynamic-changing resource constraints. We observe that smaller ViTs are intrinsically the sub-networks of a larger ViT with different widths. Thus, we propose a general framework, named Scala, to enable a single network to represent multiple smaller ViTs with flexible inference capability, which aligns with the inherent design of ViT to vary from widths. Concretely, Scala activates several subnets during training, introduces Isolated Activation to disentangle the smallest sub-network from other subnets, and leverages Scale Coordination to ensure each sub-network receives simplified, steady, and accurate learning objectives. Comprehensive empirical validations on different tasks demonstrate that with only one-shot training, Scala learns slimmable representation without modifying the original ViT structure and matches the performance of Separate Training. Compared with the prior art, Scala achieves an average improvement of 1.6% on ImageNet-1K with fewer parameters.</p>

We present UltraPixel, a novel architecture utilizing cascade diffusion models to generate high-quality images at multiple resolutions (\textit{e.g.}, 1K, 2K, and 4K) within a single model, while maintaining computational efficiency. UltraPixel leverages semantics-rich representations of lower-resolution images in a later denoising stage to guide the whole generation of highly detailed high-resolution images, significantly reducing complexity. Specifically, we introduce implicit neural representations for continuous upsampling and scale-aware normalization layers adaptable to various resolutions. Notably, both low- and high-resolution processes are performed in the most compact space, sharing the majority of parameters with less than 3$\%$ additional parameters for high-resolution outputs, largely enhancing training and inference efficiency. Our model achieves fast training with reduced data requirements, producing photo-realistic high-resolution images and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.</p>

                        <p><p>Although text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit remarkable generation capabilities,they frequently fail to accurately bind semantically related objects or attributesin the input prompts; a challenge termed semantic binding. Previous approacheseither involve intensive fine-tuning of the entire T2I model or require users orlarge language models to specify generation layouts, adding complexity. In thispaper, we define semantic binding as the task of associating a given object with itsattribute, termed attribute binding, or linking it to other related sub-objects, referredto as object binding. We introduce a novel method called Token Merging (ToMe),which enhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a singlecomposite token. This ensures that the object, its attributes and sub-objects all sharethe same cross-attention map. Additionally, to address potential confusion amongmain objects with complex textual prompts, we propose end token substitution asa complementary strategy. To further refine our approach in the initial stages ofT2I generation, where layouts are determined, we incorporate two auxiliary losses,an entropy loss and a semantic binding loss, to iteratively update the compositetoken to improve the generation integrity. We conducted extensive experiments tovalidate the effectiveness of ToMe, comparing it against various existing methodson the T2I-CompBench and our proposed GPT-4o object binding benchmark. Ourmethod is particularly effective in complex scenarios that involve multiple objectsand attributes, which previous methods often fail to address.

This effect becomes more pronounced at higher values of adapter strength and for adapters with higher ranks which are fine-tuned on smaller datasets. To address these challenges, we present FouRA, a novel low-rank method that learns projections in the Fourier domain along with learning a flexible input-dependent adapter rank selection strategy. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality. We demonstrate that FouRA enhances the generalization of fine-tuned models thanks to its adaptive rank selection. We further show that the learned projections in the frequency domain are decorrelated and prove effective when merging multiple adapters. While FouRA is motivated for vision tasks, we also demonstrate its merits for language tasks on commonsense reasoning and GLUE benchmarks.</p>

                        <p><p>Unconditional generation -- the problem of modeling data distribution without relying on human-annotated labels -- is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in generative models, creating a potential of learning from large-scale unlabeled data. In the literature, the generation quality of an unconditional method has been much worse than that of its conditional counterpart. This gap can be attributed to the lack of semantic information provided by labels. In this work, we show that one can close this gap by generating semantic representations in the representation space produced by a self-supervised encoder. These representations can be used to condition the image generator. This framework, called Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides an effective solution to the unconditional generation problem without using labels. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe that RCG significantly improves unconditional generation quality: e.g., it achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256, largely reducing the previous best of 5.91 by a relative 64%. Our unconditional results are situated in the same tier as the leading class-conditional ones. We hope these encouraging observations will attract the community's attention to the fundamental problem of unconditional generation.

                        <p><p>Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses.     In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads.     Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p>

A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines. We introduce T2IScoreScore, a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set of increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate  between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</p>

                        <p><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with training only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p>

However, most diffusion models struggle with this task, \textit{i.e.}, often generating an object that predominantly reflects either the text or the image due to an imbalance between their inputs. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Text-Image Harmony (ATIH) to generate novel and surprising objects.First, we introduce a scale factor and an injection step to balance text and image features in cross-attention and to preserve image information in self-attention during the text-image inversion diffusion process, respectively. Second, to better integrate object text and image, we design a balanced loss function with a noise parameter, ensuring both optimal editability and fidelity of the object image. Third, to adaptively adjust these parameters, we present a novel similarity score function that not only maximizes the similarities between the generated object image and the input text/image but also balances these similarities to harmonize text and image integration.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing remarkable object creations such as colobus-glass jar. https://xzr52.github.io/ATIH/</p>

However, the synthesis quality often deteriorates when asked to generate images that faithfully represent complex prompts involving multiple attributes and objects. While previous studies suggest that blended text embeddings lead to improper attribute binding, few have explored this in depth. In this work, we critically examine the limitations of the CLIP text encoder in understanding attributes and investigate how this affects diffusion models. We discern a phenomenon of attribute bias in the text space and highlight a contextual issue in padding embeddings that entangle different concepts. We propose Magnet, a novel training-free approach to tackle the attribute binding problem. We introduce positive and negative binding vectors to enhance disentanglement, further with a neighbor strategy to increase accuracy. Extensive experiments show that Magnet significantly improves synthesis quality and binding accuracy with negligible computational cost, enabling the generation of unconventional and unnatural concepts.</p>

                        <p><p>Recent advancements in Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) for text-to-image generation have streamlined user input while ensuring high-quality image output. However, most APO methods are trained assuming a fixed text-to-image model, which is impractical given the emergence of new models. To address this, we propose a novel task, model-generalized automatic prompt optimization (MGAPO), which trains APO methods on a set of known models to enable generalization to unseen models during testing. MGAPO presents significant challenges. First, we experimentally confirm the suboptimal performance of existing APO methods on unseen models. We then introduce a two-stage prompt optimization method, AP-Adapter. In the first stage, a large language model is used to rewrite the prompts. In the second stage, we propose a novel method to construct an enhanced representation space by leveraging inter-model differences. This space captures the characteristics of multiple domain models, storing them as domain prototypes. These prototypes serve as anchors to adjust prompt representations, enabling generalization to unseen models. The optimized prompt representations are subsequently used to generate conditional representations for controllable image generation. We curate a multi-modal, multi-model dataset that includes multiple diffusion models and their corresponding text-image data, and conduct experiments under a model generalization setting. The experimental results demonstrate the AP-Adapter's ability to enable the automatic prompts to generalize well to previously unseen diffusion models, generating high-quality images.</p>

                        <p><p>Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers' attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.

                        <p><p>The proliferation of 2D foundation models has sparked research into adapting them for open-world 3D instance segmentation. Recent methods introduce a paradigm that leverages superpoints as geometric primitives and incorporates 2D multi-view masks from Segment Anything model (SAM) as merging guidance, achieving outstanding zero-shot instance segmentation results. However, the limited use of 3D priors restricts the segmentation performance. Previous methods calculate the 3D superpoints solely based on estimated normal from spatial coordinates, resulting in under-segmentation for instances with similar geometry. Besides, the heavy reliance on SAM and hand-crafted algorithms in 2D space suffers from over-segmentation due to SAM's inherent part-level segmentation tendency. To address these issues, we propose SA3DIP, a novel method for Segmenting Any 3D Instances via exploiting potential 3D Priors. Specifically, on one hand, we generate complementary 3D primitives based on both geometric and textural priors, which reduces the initial errors that accumulate in subsequent procedures. On the other hand, we introduce supplemental constraints from the 3D space by using a 3D detector to guide a further merging process. Furthermore, we notice a considerable portion of low-quality ground truth annotations in ScanNetV2 benchmark, which affect the fair evaluations. Thus, we present ScanNetV2-INS with complete ground truth labels and supplement additional instances for 3D class-agnostic instance segmentation. Experimental evaluations on various 2D-3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Our code and proposed ScanNetV2-INS dataset are available HERE.</p>

                        <p><p>Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation.We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. Code and Models: https://github.com/gaobb/MetaUAS.</p>

In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective that imparts auxiliary constraints by regulating the feature space under weak supervision. Our initial investigation identifies which distributions accurately characterize the feature space, subsequently leveraging this priori to guide the alignment of the weakly supervised embeddings. Specifically, we analyze the superiority of the mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions (moVMF) among several common distribution candidates. Accordingly, we develop a Distribution Guidance Network (DGNet), which comprises a weakly supervised learning branch and a distribution alignment branch. Leveraging reliable clustering initialization derived from the weakly supervised learning branch, the distribution alignment branch alternately updates the parameters of the moVMF and the network, ensuring alignment with the moVMF-defined latent space. Extensive experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of our distribution choice and network design. Consequently, DGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple datasets and various weakly supervised settings.</p>

                        <p><p>LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation enables the robots to obtain fine-grained semantic information of the surrounding environment. Recently, many works project the point cloud onto the 2D image and adopt the 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or vision transformer for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. However, since more than one point can be projected onto the same 2D position but only one point can be preserved, the previous 2D projection-based segmentation methods suffer from inevitable quantized information loss, which results in incomplete geometric structure, especially for small objects. To avoid quantized information loss, in this paper, we propose a novel spherical frustum structure, which preserves all points projected onto the same 2D position. Additionally, a hash-based representation is proposed for memory-efficient spherical frustum storage. Based on the spherical frustum structure, the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution (SFC) and Frustum Farthest Point Sampling (F2PS) are proposed to convolve and sample the points stored in spherical frustums respectively. Finally, we present the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution Network (SFCNet) to adopt 2D CNNs for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation without quantized information loss. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our SFCNet outperforms previous 2D projection-based semantic segmentation methods based on conventional spherical projection and shows better performance on small object segmentation by preserving complete geometric structure.

                        <p>High dynamic range (HDR) novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to create photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using HDR imaging techniques. The rendered HDR images capture a wider range of brightness levels containing more details of the scene than normal low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR NVS methods are mainly based on NeRF. They suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework, High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS), which can efficiently render novel HDR views and reconstruct LDR images with a user input exposure time. Specifically, we design a Dual Dynamic Range (DDR) Gaussian point cloud model that uses spherical harmonics to fit HDR color and employs an MLP-based tone-mapper to render LDR color. The HDR and LDR colors are then fed into two Parallel Differentiable Rasterization (PDR) processes to reconstruct HDR and LDR views. To establish the data foundation for the research of 3D Gaussian splatting-based methods in HDR NVS, we recalibrate the camera parameters and compute the initial positions for Gaussian point clouds. Comprehensive experiments show that HDR-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art NeRF-based method by 3.84 and 1.91 dB on LDR and HDR NVS while enjoying 1000$\times$ inference speed and only costing 6.3\% training time.

                        <p><p>Despite the substantial progress of novel view synthesis, existing methods, either based on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or more recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), suffer significant degradation when the input becomes sparse. Numerous efforts have been introduced to alleviate this problem, but they still struggle to synthesize satisfactory results efficiently, especially in the large scene. In this paper, we propose SCGaussian, a Structure Consistent Gaussian Splatting method using matching priors to learn 3D consistent scene structure. Considering the high interdependence of Gaussian attributes, we optimize the scene structure in two folds: rendering geometry and, more importantly, the position of Gaussian primitives, which is hard to be directly constrained in the vanilla 3DGS due to the non-structure property. To achieve this, we present a hybrid Gaussian representation. Besides the ordinary non-structure Gaussian primitives, our model also consists of ray-based Gaussian primitives that are bound to matching rays and whose optimization of their positions is restricted along the ray. Thus, we can utilize the matching correspondence to directly enforce the position of these Gaussian primitives to converge to the surface points where rays intersect. Extensive experiments on forward-facing, surrounding, and complex large scenes show the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency.

Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 125.42\% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81\% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities.</p>

                        <p><p>Human image animation aims to generate a human motion video from the inputs of a reference human image and a target motion video. Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training.</p>

Most previous video generation models are trained on short video clips, while recently there has been increasing interest in training long video generation models directly on longer videos. However, the lack of such high-quality long videos impedes the advancement long video generation. To promote research in long video generation, we desire a new dataset with four key features essential for training long video generation models: (1) long videos covering at least 10 seconds, (2) long-take videos without cuts, (3) large motion and diverse contents, and (4) temporally dense captions. To achieve this, we introduce a new pipeline for filtering high-quality long-take videos and generating temporally dense captions. Specifically, we define a set of metrics to quantitatively assess video quality including scene cuts, dynamic degrees, and semantic-level scores, enabling us to filter high-quality long-take videos from a large amount of source videos. Subsequently, we develop a hierarchical video captioning pipeline to annotate long videos with temporally-dense captions. With this pipeline, we curate the first long-take video dataset, LVD-2M, comprising 2 million long-take videos, each covering more than 10 seconds and annotated with temporally dense captions. We further validate the effectiveness of LVD-2M by fine-tuning video generation models to generate long videos with dynamic motions. We believe it will significantly contribute to future research in long video generation.</p>

                        <p><p>Gaze following and social gaze prediction are fundamental tasks providing insights into human communication behaviors, intent, and social interactions. Most previous approaches addressed these tasks separately, either by designing highly specialized social gaze models that do not generalize to other social gaze tasks or by considering social gaze inference as an ad-hoc post-processing of the gaze following task. Furthermore, the vast majority of gaze following approaches have proposed models that can handle only one person at a time and are static, therefore failing to take advantage of social interactions and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we address these limitations and introduce a novel framework to jointly predict the gaze target and social gaze label for all people in the scene. It comprises (i) a temporal, transformer-based architecture that, in addition to frame tokens, handles person-specific tokens capturing the gaze information related to each individual; (ii) a new dataset, VSGaze, built from multiple gaze following and social gaze datasets by extending and validating head detections and tracks, and unifying annotation types. We demonstrate that our model can address and benefit from training on all tasks jointly, achieving state-of-the-art results for multi-person gaze following and social gaze prediction. Our annotations and code will be made publicly available.</p>

                        <p><p>A recent study has shown that large-scale pretraining datasets are very biased: they can be easily classified by modern neural networks. However, the concrete forms of bias among these datasets remain unclear. In this study, we propose a framework to identify the unique visual attributes distinguishing these datasets. Our approach applies various transformations to extract semantic, structural, boundary, color, and frequency information from datasets and assess how much each type of information contributes to their bias. We further decompose their semantic bias with object-level queries, and leverage natural language methods to generate detailed, open-ended descriptions of each dataset's characteristics. Our work aims to help researchers understand the bias in existing large-scale datasets and build more diverse and representative ones in the future.

                        <p>Despite the effectiveness of data selection for pretraining and instruction fine-tuninglarge language models (LLMs), improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning(SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexityof fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalabledata selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which trains a smallmodel, clusters loss trajectories of the examples, and samples from these clusters toguide data selection for larger models. We prove that during fine-tuning, sampleswithin the same loss trajectory cluster exhibit similar gradients. Then, we showthat S2L subsets have a bounded gradient error w.r.t. the full data, hence guaranteeconvergence to the neighborhood of the optimal solution. We demonstrate throughextensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT formathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data requirement to just $11$%of the original MathInstruct dataset to match full dataset performance whileoutperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of $4.7$%across $6$ in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50Kdata for SFT, S2L achieves a $32.7$% accuracy on the challenging MATHbenchmark, improving Phi-2 by $16.6$%. In clinical text summarization on theMIMIC-III dataset, S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset usingonly $50$% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform scalable data selection using areference model $100\times$ smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing thecomputational cost.</p>

                        <p><p>Pretraining data selection has the potential to improve language model pretraining efficiency by utilizing higher-quality data from massive web data corpora. Current data selection methods, which rely on either hand-crafted rules or larger reference models, are conducted statically and do not capture the evolving data preferences during pretraining. In this paper, we introduce <em>model-aware data selection with data influence models (MATES)</em>, where a data influence model continuously adapts to the evolving data preferences of the pretraining model and then selects the data most effective for the current pretraining progress. Specifically, we collect oracle data influence by locally probing the pretraining model and fine-tune a small data influence model to approximate it accurately. The data influence model then predicts data influence over the whole pretraining corpus and selects the most influential data for the next pretraining stage. Experiments of pretraining 410M and 1B models on the C4 dataset demonstrate that MATES significantly outperforms random data selection on extensive downstream tasks. It doubles the gains achieved by the state-of-the-art data selection approach that leverages larger reference models and reduces the total FLOPs required to reach certain performances by half. Further analyses validate the effectiveness of the locally probed oracle data influence and the approximation with data influence models.

                        <p><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for developing effective and safe language models. Traditional approaches focus on aligning models during the instruction tuning or reinforcement learning stages, referred to in this paper as `\textit{post alignment}'. We argue that alignment during the pre-training phase, which we term 'native alignment', warrants investigation. Native alignment aims to prevent unaligned content from the beginning, rather than relying on post-hoc processing. This approach leverages extensively aligned pre-training data to enhance the effectiveness and usability of pre-trained models. Our study specifically explores the application of native alignment in the context of Arabic LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the impact of native alignment on model performance and alignment stability. Additionally, we release open-source Arabic LLMs that demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, providing significant benefits to the Arabic LLM community.</p>

                        <p>Label distribution learning is a powerful learning paradigm to deal with label polysemy and has been widely applied in many practical tasks. A significant obstacle to the effective utilization of label distribution is the substantial expenses of accurate quantifying the label distributions. To tackle this challenge, label enhancement methods automatically infer label distributions from more easily accessible multi-label data based on binary annotations. However, the binary annotation of multi-label data requires experts to accurately assess whether each label can describe the instance, which may diminish the annotating efficiency and heighten the risk of erroneous annotation since the relationship between the label and the instance is unclear in many practical scenarios. Therefore, we propose to predict label distribution from ternary labels, allowing experts to annotate labels in a three-way annotation scheme. They can annotate the label as "$0$" indicating "uncertain relevant" if it is difficult to definitively determine whether the label can describe the instance, in addition to the binary annotation of "$1$" indicating "definitely relevant" and "$-1$" indicating "definitely irrelevant". Both the theoretical and methodological studies are conducted for the proposed learning paradigm. In the theoretical part, we conduct a quantitative comparison of approximation error between ternary and binary labels to elucidate the superiority of ternary labels over binary labels. In the methodological part, we propose a Categorical distribution with monotonicity and orderliness to model the mapping from label description degrees to ternary labels, which can serve as a loss function or as a probability distribution, allowing most existing label enhancement methods to be adapted to our task. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.</p>

                        <p><p>The widespread success of deep learning models today is owed to the curation of extensive datasets significant in size and complexity. However, such models frequently pick up inherent biases in the data during the training process, leading to unreliable predictions. Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we present ConBias, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets. ConBias represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset. Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that data augmentation based on a balanced concept distribution augmented by ConBias improves generalization performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                        <p>Although the transformer architecture has come to dominate other models for text and image data, its application to irregularly-spaced longitudinal data has been limited. We introduce a variant of the transformer that enables it to more smoothly impute such functional data. We augment the vanilla transformer with a simple module we call SAND (self-attention on derivatives), which naturally encourages smoothness by modeling the sub-derivative of the imputed curve. On the theoretical front, we prove the number of hidden nodes required by a network with SAND to achieve an $\epsilon$ prediction error bound for functional imputation. Extensive experiments over various types of functional data demonstrate that transformers with SAND produce better imputations than both their standard counterparts as well as transformers augmented with alternative approaches to encode the inductive bias of smoothness. SAND also outperforms standard statistical methods for functional imputation like kernel smoothing and PACE.</p>

                        <p><p>Transferring visual-language knowledge from large-scale foundation models for video recognition has proved to be effective. To bridge the domain gap, additional parametric modules are added to capture the temporal information. However, zero-shot generalization diminishes with the increase in the number of specialized parameters, making existing works a trade-off between zero-shot and close-set performance. In this paper, we present MoTE, a novel framework that enables generalization and specialization to be balanced in one unified model. Our approach tunes a mixture of temporal experts to learn multiple task views with various degrees of data fitting. To maximally preserve the knowledge of each expert, we propose Weight Merging Regularization, which regularizes the merging process of experts in weight space. Additionally with temporal feature modulation to regularize the contribution of temporal feature during test. We achieve a sound balance between zero-shot and close-set video recognition tasks and obtain state-of-the-art or competitive results on various datasets, including Kinetics-400 \&amp; 600, UCF, and HMDB.

                        <p><p>Object tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision, requiring the localization of objects of interest across video frames. Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in visual generation, making them well-suited for addressing several requirements of the tracking problem. This work proposes a novel diffusion-based methodology to formulate the tracking task. Firstly, their conditional process allows for injecting indications of the target object into the generation process. Secondly, diffusion mechanics can be developed to inherently model temporal correspondences, enabling the reconstruction of actual frames in video. However, existing diffusion models rely on extensive and unnecessary mapping to a Gaussian noise domain, which can be replaced by a more efficient and stable interpolation process. Our proposed interpolation mechanism draws inspiration from classic image-processing techniques, offering a more interpretable, stable, and faster approach tailored specifically for the object tracking task. By leveraging the strengths of diffusion models while circumventing their limitations, our Diffusion-based INterpolation TrackeR (DINTR) presents a promising new paradigm and achieves a superior multiplicity on seven benchmarks across five indicator representations.</p>

In this paper, we introduce the new AeroEye dataset that focuses on multi-object relationship modeling in aerial videos. Our AeroEye dataset features various drone scenes and includes a visually comprehensive and precise collection of predicates that capture the intricate relationships and spatial arrangements among objects. To this end, we propose the novel Cyclic Graph Transformer (CYCLO) approach that allows the model to capture both direct and long-range temporal dependencies by continuously updating the history of interactions in a circular manner. The proposed approach also allows one to handle sequences with inherent cyclical patterns and process object relationships in the correct sequential order. Therefore, it can effectively capture periodic and overlapping relationships while minimizing information loss. The extensive experiments on the AeroEye dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CYCLO model, demonstrating its potential to perform scene understanding on drone videos. Finally, the CYCLO method consistently achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on two in-the-wild scene graph generation benchmarks, i.e., PVSG and ASPIRe.</p>

                        <p><p>Temporal action segmentation and long-term action anticipation are two popular vision tasks for the temporal analysis of actions in videos. Despite apparent relevance and potential complementarity, these two problems have been investigated as separate and distinct tasks. In this work, we tackle these two problems, action segmentation, and action anticipation, jointly using a unified diffusion model dubbed ActFusion. The key idea to unification is to train the model to effectively handle both visible and invisible parts of the sequence in an integrated manner;the visible part is for temporal segmentation, and the invisible part is for future anticipation. To this end, we introduce a new anticipative masking strategy during training in which a late part of the video frames is masked as invisible, and learnable tokens replace these frames to learn to predict the invisible future.Experimental results demonstrate the bi-directional benefits between action segmentation and anticipation.ActFusion achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the standard benchmarks of 50 Salads, Breakfast, and GTEA, outperforming task-specific models in both of the two tasks with a single unified model through joint learning.</p>

However, in many sequence modeling problems, the underlying process is inherently modular and it is of interest to have inductive biases that mimic this modular structure. In this paper, we introduce SlotSSMs, a novel framework for incorporating independent mechanisms into SSMs to preserve or encourage separation of information. Unlike conventional SSMs that maintain a monolithic state vector, SlotSSMs maintains the state as a collection of multiple vectors called slots. Crucially, the state transitions are performed independently per slot with sparse interactions across slots implemented via the bottleneck of self-attention. In experiments, we evaluate our model in object-centric learning, 3D visual reasoning, and long-context video understanding tasks, which involve modeling multiple objects and their long-range temporal dependencies. We find that our proposed design offers substantial performance gains over existing sequence modeling methods. Project page is available at \url{https://slotssms.github.io/}</p>

                        <p><p><em>Visual reprogramming</em> (VR) leverages the intrinsic capabilities of pretrained vision models by adapting their input or output interfaces to solve downstream tasks whose labels (i.e., downstream labels) might be totally different from the labels associated with the pretrained models (i.e., pretrained labels). When adapting the output interface, label mapping methods transform the pretrained labels to downstream labels by establishing a gradient-free one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of labels.However, in this paper, we reveal that one-to-one mappings may overlook the complex relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. Motivated by this observation, we propose a <strong><em>B</strong>ayesian-guided <strong>L</strong>abel <strong>M</strong>apping</em> (BLM) method. BLM constructs an iteratively-updated probabilistic label mapping matrix, with each element quantifying a pairwise relationship between pretrained and downstream labels.The assignment of values to the constructed matrix is guided by Bayesian conditional probability, considering the joint distribution of the downstream labels and the labels predicted by the pretrained model on downstream samples. Experiments conducted on both pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNeXt) and vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate the superior performance of BLM over existing label mapping methods. The success of BLM also offers a probabilistic lens through which to understand and analyze the effectiveness of VR.Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/BayesianLM.</p>

                        <p><p>We introduce a decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, for large language models, which only caches key-value pairs once. It consists of two components, i.e., a cross-decoder stacked upon a self-decoder. The self-decoder efficiently encodes global key-value (KV) caches that are reused by the cross-decoder via cross-attention. The overall model behaves like a decoder-only Transformer, although YOCO only caches once. The design substantially reduces GPU memory demands, yet retains global attention capability. Additionally, the computation flow enables prefilling to early exit without changing the final output, thereby significantly speeding up the prefill stage. Experimental results demonstrate that YOCO achieves favorable performance compared to Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and number of training tokens. We also extend YOCO to 1M context length with near-perfect needle retrieval accuracy. The profiling results show that YOCO improves inference memory, prefill latency, and throughput by orders of magnitude across context lengths and model sizes.</p>

                        <p><p>Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm designed to protect user data privacy, which has been successfully implemented across various scenarios. In traditional federated learning, the entire parameter set of local models is updated and averaged in each training round. Although this full network update method maximizes knowledge acquisition and sharing for each model layer, it prevents the layers of the global model from cooperating effectively to complete the tasks of each client, a challenge we refer to as layer mismatch. This mismatch problem recurs after every parameter averaging, consequently slowing down model convergence and degrading overall performance. To address the layer mismatch issue, we introduce the FedPart method, which restricts model updates to either a single layer or a few layers during each communication round. Furthermore, to maintain the efficiency of knowledge acquisition and sharing, we develop several strategies to select trainable layers in each round, including sequential updating and multi-round cycle training. Through both theoretical analysis and experiments, our findings demonstrate that the FedPart method significantly surpasses conventional full network update strategies in terms of convergence speed and accuracy, while also reducing communication and computational overheads.</p>

                        <p><p>Existing prompt-tuning methods have demonstrated impressive performances in continual learning (CL), by selecting and updating relevant prompts in the vision-transformer models. On the contrary, this paper aims to learn each task by tuning the prompts in the direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by previous tasks' features, so as to ensure no interference on tasks that have been learned to overcome catastrophic forgetting in CL. However, different from the orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt gradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely different and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear self-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the LayerNorm in the transformer block. Theoretically, we have finally deduced two consistency conditions to achieve the prompt gradient orthogonal projection, which provide a theoretical guarantee of eliminating interference on previously learned knowledge via the self-attention mechanism in visual prompt tuning. In practice, an effective null-space-based approximation solution has been proposed to implement the prompt gradient orthogonal projection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-forgetting on four class-incremental benchmarks with diverse pre-trained baseline models, and our approach achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose <em>Learning from Teaching</em> (<strong>LoT</strong>), a novel regularization technique for deep neural networks to enhance generalization. Inspired by the human ability to capture concise and abstract patterns, we hypothesize that generalizable correlations are expected to be easier to imitate. LoT operationalizes this concept to improve the generalization of the main model with auxiliary student learners. The student learners are trained by the main model and, in turn, provide feedback to help the main model capture more generalizable and imitable correlations. Our experimental results across several domains, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and methodologies like Reinforcement Learning, demonstrate that the introduction of LoT brings significant benefits compared to training models on the original dataset. The results suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of LoT in identifying generalizable information at the right scales while discarding spurious data correlations, thus making LoT a valuable addition to current machine learning.

                        <p>In many machine learning tasks, data is inherently sequential. Most existing algorithms learn from sequential data in an auto-regressive manner, which predicts the next unseen data point based on the observed sequence, implicitly assuming the presence of an \emph{evolving pattern} embedded in the data that can be leveraged. However, identifying and assessing evolving patterns in learning tasks often relies on subjective judgments rooted in the prior knowledge of human experts, lacking a standardized quantitative measure. Furthermore, such measures enable us to determine the suitability of employing sequential models effectively and make informed decisions on the temporal order of time series data, and feature/data selection processes. To address this issue, we introduce the Evolving Rate (EvoRate), which quantitatively approximates the intensity of evolving patterns in the data with Mutual Information. Furthermore, in some temporal data with neural mutual information estimations, we only have snapshots at different timestamps, lacking correspondence, which hinders EvoRate estimation. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoRate$_\mathcal{W}$, aiming to establish correspondence with optimal transport for estimating the first-order EvoRate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets including images and tabular data validate the efficacy of our EvoRate.</p>

                        <p><p>Previous work on Universal Transformers (UTs) has demonstrated the importance of parameter sharing across layers. By allowing recurrence in depth, UTs have advantages over standard Transformers in learning compositional generalizations, but layer-sharing comes with a practical limitation of parameter-compute ratio: it drastically reduces the parameter count compared to the non-shared model with the same dimensionality. Naively scaling up the layer size to compensate for the loss of parameters makes its computational resource requirements prohibitive. In practice, no previous work has succeeded in proposing a shared-layer Transformer design that is competitive in parameter count-dominated tasks such as language modeling. Here we propose MoEUT (pronounced "moot"), an effective mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based shared-layer Transformer architecture, which combines several recent advances in MoEs for both feedforward and attention layers of standard Transformers together with novel layer-normalization and grouping schemes that are specific and crucial to UTs. The resulting UT model, for the first time, slightly outperforms standard Transformers on language modeling tasks such as BLiMP and PIQA, while using significantly less compute and memory.</p>

                        <p><p>At a cocktail party, humans exhibit an impressive ability to direct their attention. The auditory attention detection (AAD) approach seeks to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as EEG signals. However, current AAD algorithms overlook the spatial distribution information within EEG signals and lack the ability to capture long-range latent dependencies, limiting the model's ability to decode brain activity.To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual attention refinement network with spatiotemporal construction for AAD, named DARNet, which consists of the spatiotemporal construction module, dual attention refinement module, and feature fusion \&amp; classifier module. Specifically, the spatiotemporal construction module aims to construct more expressive spatiotemporal feature representations, by capturing the spatial distribution characteristics of EEG signals. The dual attention refinement module aims to extract different levels of temporal patterns in EEG signals and enhance the model's ability to capture long-range latent dependencies. The feature fusion \&amp; classifier module aims to aggregate temporal patterns and dependencies from different levels and obtain the final classification results.The experimental results indicate that DARNet achieved excellent classification performance, particularly under short decision windows. While maintaining excellent classification performance, DARNet significantly reduces the number of required parameters. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, DARNet reduces the parameter count by 91\%. Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DARNet.git.</p>

                        <p><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved great success in solving many challenging tasks while their black-box nature hinders interpretability and real-world applicability, making it difficult for human experts to interpret and understand DRL policies. Existing works on interpretable reinforcement learning have shown promise in extracting decision tree (DT) based policies from DRL policies with most focus on the single-agent settings while prior attempts to introduce DT policies in multi-agent scenarios mainly focus on heuristic designs which do not provide any quantitative guarantees on the expected return.In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the return gap between the oracle expert policy and an optimal decision tree policy. This enables us to recast the DT extraction problem into a novel non-euclidean clustering problem over the local observation and action values space of each agent, with action values as cluster labels and the upper bound on the return gap as clustering loss.Both the algorithm and the upper bound are extended to multi-agent decentralized DT extractions by an iteratively-grow-DT procedure guided by an action-value function conditioned on the current DTs of other agents. Further, we propose the Return-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm, which is a surprisingly simple design and is integrated with reinforcement learning through the utilization of a novel Regularized Information Maximization loss. Evaluations on tasks like D4RL show that RGMDT significantly outperforms heuristic DT-based baselines and can achieve nearly optimal returns under given DT complexity constraints (e.g., maximum number of DT nodes).</p>

Here, we address the storage explosion challenge to promote the capacity of mapping the complex CNN models by LUT. We introduce an innovative separable mapping strategy to achieve over $7\times$ storage reduction, transforming the storage from exponential dependence on kernel size to a linear relationship. Moreover, we design a dynamic discretization mechanism to decompose the activation and compress the quantization scale that further shrinks the LUT storage by $4.48\times$. As a result, the storage requirement of our proposed TinyLUT is around 4.1\% of MuLUT-SDY-X2 and amenable to on-chip cache, yielding competitive accuracy with over $5\times$ lower inference latency on Raspberry 4B than FSRCNN. Our proposed TinyLUT enables superior inference speed on edge devices with new state-of-the-art accuracy on both of image super-resolution and denoising, showcasing the potential of applying this method to various image restoration tasks at the edge.

                        <p><p>Point-based methods have made significant progress, but improving their scalability in large-scale 3D scenes is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we delve into the point-based method and develop a simpler, faster, stronger variant model, dubbed as LinNet. In particular, we first propose the disassembled set abstraction (DSA) module, which is more effective than the previous version of set abstraction. It achieves more efficient local aggregation by leveraging spatial anisotropy and channel anisotropy separately. Additionally, by mapping 3D point clouds onto 1D space-filling curves, we enable parallelization of downsampling and neighborhood queries on GPUs with linear complexity. LinNet, as a purely point-based method, outperforms most previous methods in both indoor and outdoor scenes without any extra attention, and sparse convolution but merely relying on a simple MLP. It achieves the mIoU of 73.7\%, 81.4\%, and 69.1\% on the S3DIS Area5, NuScenes, and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks, respectively, while speeding up almost 10x times over PointNeXt. Our work further reveals both the efficacy and efficiency potential of the vanilla point-based models in large-scale representation learning. Our code will be available upon publication.</p>

                        <p>Penalizing the nuclear norm of a function's Jacobian encourages it to locally behave like a low-rank linear map. Such functions vary locally along only a handful of directions, making the Jacobian nuclear norm a natural regularizer for machine learning problems. However, this regularizer is intractable for high-dimensional problems, as it requires computing a large Jacobian matrix and taking its SVD. We show how to efficiently penalize the Jacobian nuclear norm using techniques tailor-made for deep learning. We prove that for functions parametrized as compositions $f = g \circ h$, one may equivalently penalize the average squared Frobenius norm of $Jg$ and $Jh$. We then propose a denoising-style approximation that avoids the Jacobian computations altogether. Our method is simple, efficient, and accurate, enabling Jacobian nuclear norm regularization to scale to high-dimensional deep learning problems. We complement our theory with an empirical study of our regularizer's performance and investigate applications to denoising and representation learning.</p>

                        <p><p>Embedders play a central role in machine learning, projecting any object into numerical representations that can, in turn, be leveraged to perform various downstream tasks. The evaluation of embedding models typically depends on domain-specific empirical approaches utilizing downstream tasks, primarily because of the lack of a standardized framework for comparison. However, acquiring adequately large and representative datasets for conducting these assessments is not always viable and can prove to be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.  In this paper, we present a unified approach to evaluate embedders. First, we establish theoretical foundations for comparing embedding models, drawing upon the concepts of sufficiency and informativeness. We then leverage these concepts to devise a tractable comparison criterion (information sufficiency), leading to a task-agnostic and self-supervised ranking procedure. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach aligns closely with the capability of embedding models to facilitate various downstream tasks in both natural language processing and molecular biology. This effectively offers practitioners a valuable tool for prioritizing model trials.</p>

                        <p>Correspondences in point cloud registration are prone to outliers, significantly reducing registration accuracy and highlighting the need for precise inlier identification. In this paper, we propose a robust inlier identification algorithm for point cloud registration by reformulating the conventional registration problem as an alignment error $\ell_0$-minimization problem. The $\ell_0$-minimization problem is formulated for each local set, where those local sets are built on a compatibility graph of input correspondences. To resolve the $\ell_0$-minimization, we develop a novel two-stage decoupling strategy, which first decouples the alignment error into a rotation fitting error and a translation fitting error. Second, null-space matrices are employed to decouple inlier identification from the estimation of rotation and translation respectively, thereby applying Bayesian theory to $\ell_0$-minimization problems and solving for fitting errors. Correspondences with the smallest errors are identified as inliers to generate a transformation hypothesis for each local set. The best hypothesis is selected to perform registration. We demonstrate that the proposed inlier identification algorithm is robust under high outlier ratios and noise through experiments. Extensive results on the KITTI, 3DMatch, and 3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both traditional and learning-based methods in various indoor and outdoor scenes.</p>

                        <p><p>In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative to post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST allows for a much more memory efficient training process,as it maintains sparsity throughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail to capitalize on this. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much less efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, mostimplementations simulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of classificationwith large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount. With a label space of possibly millions of candidates,the classification layer alone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a fixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET); however, severely hampers training convergence, especiallyat the largest label spaces. We find that the gradients fed back from the classifier into the text encoder make itmuch more difficult to learn good input representations, despite using a dense encoder.By employing an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we recover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we demonstrate the applicability of DST in a challenging domain, characterized by a highly skewed label distribution, that lies outside of DST's typical benchmark datasets, and enable end-to-end training with millions of labels on commodity hardware.</p>

Our method allows a wide flexibility in the encoder and decoder architectures and does not require group-specific layers. In addition, we show that our model theoretically serves as a superset of methods that learn group actions on the data space. We test our approach on five image datasets with diverse groups acting on them and demonstrate superior performance to recently proposed methods for modeling group actions.</p>

                        <p><p>Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose <em>position coupling</em>, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more "relevant" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, our models trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to <em>200-digit</em> additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as Nx2 multiplication and a two-dimensional task.

                        <p>In this paper, we introduce Cosine Autoencoder (CosAE), a novel, generic Autoencoder that seamlessly leverages the classic Fourier series with a feed-forward neural network. CosAE represents an input image as a series of 2D Cosine time series, each defined by a tuple of learnable frequency and Fourier coefficients. This method stands in contrast to a conventional Autoencoder that often sacrifices detail in their reduced-resolution bottleneck latent spaces. CosAE, however, encodes frequency coefficients, i.e., the amplitudes and phases, in its bottleneck. This encoding enables extreme spatial compression, e.g., $64\times$ downsampled feature maps in the bottleneck, without losing detail upon decoding. We showcase the advantage of CosAE via extensive experiments on flexible-resolution super-resolution and blind image restoration, two highly challenging tasks that demand the restoration network to effectively generalize to complex and even unknown image degradations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its capability to learn a generalizable representation for image restoration.

                        <p><p>Transformers with linear attention (i.e., linear transformers) and state-space models have recently been suggested as a viable linear-time alternative to transformers with softmax attention. However, these models still underperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context retrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace the additive update in linear transformers with the delta rule (DeltaNet) have been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms for training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus inefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the delta rule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing products of Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet to standard language modeling settings. We train a 1.3B model for 100B tokens and find that it outperforms recent linear-time baselines such as Mamba and GLA in terms of perplexity and zero-shot performance on downstream tasks. We also experiment with two hybrid models which combine DeltaNet layers with (1) sliding-window attention layers every other layer or (2) two global attention layers, and find that these hybrids outperform strong transformer baselines.</p>

                        <p><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-invasive extraction of blood volume pulse signals through imaging, transforming spatial-temporal data into time series signals. Advances in end-to-end rPPG approaches have focused on this transformation where attention mechanisms are crucial for feature extraction. However, existing methods compute attention disjointly across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. Here, we propose the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM), which jointly computes multidimensional attention from voxel embeddings using nonnegative matrix factorization. To demonstrate FSAM's effectiveness, we developed FactorizePhys, an end-to-end 3D-CNN architecture for estimating blood volume pulse signals from raw video frames. Our approach adeptly factorizes voxel embeddings to achieve comprehensive spatial, temporal, and channel attention, enhancing performance of generic signal extraction tasks. Furthermore, we deploy FSAM within an existing 2D-CNN-based rPPG architecture to illustrate its versatility. FSAM and FactorizePhys are thoroughly evaluated against state-of-the-art rPPG methods, each representing different types of architecture and attention mechanism. We perform ablation studies to investigate the architectural decisions and hyperparameters of FSAM. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and intuitive visualization of learned spatial-temporal features substantiate the effectiveness of FSAM and enhanced cross-dataset generalization in estimating rPPG signals, suggesting its broader potential as a multidimensional attention mechanism.

We leverage this unique capability to propose NoMAD-Attention, an efficient attention algorithm that replaces MAD operations with in-register lookups. Through hardware-aware algorithmic designs, NoMAD-Attention achieves the computation of attention scores using repeated fast accesses to SIMD registers. NoMAD-Attention works with pre-trained attention-based LLMs without model finetuning. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that NoMAD-Attention maintains the quality of the original LLMs well and speeds up the 4-bit quantized LLaMA-7B-based model by up to $2 \times$ at 16k context length.</p>

                        <p><p>Road network representation learning aims to learn compressed and effective vectorized representations for road segments that are applicable to numerous tasks. In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing methods, particularly their overemphasis on the distance effect as outlined in the First Law of Geography. In response,  we propose to endow road network representation with the principles of the recent Third Law of Geography. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework that employs geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling, ensuring that road segments with similar geographic configurations yield similar representations, and vice versa, aligning with the principles stated in the Third Law. The framework further fuses the Third Law with the First Law through a dual contrastive learning objective to effectively balance the implications of both laws. We evaluate our framework on two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks. The results show that the integration of the Third Law significantly improves the performance of road segment representations in downstream tasks.</p>

Our method optimizes for the permutations of network neurons while ensuring global coherence across all layers, and it outperforms recent layer-local approaches in a set of challenging scenarios. We then generalize the formulation to the $N$-models scenario to enforce cycle consistency of the permutations with guarantees, allowing circular compositions of permutations to be computed without accumulating error along the path.     We qualitatively and quantitatively motivate the need for such a constraint, showing its benefits when merging homogeneous sets of models in scenarios spanning varying architectures and datasets. We finally show that, when coupled with activation renormalization, the approach yields the best results in the task.</p>

                        <p><p>It is largely agreed that social network links are formed due to either homophily or social influence. Inspired by this, we aim at understanding the generation of links via providing a novel embedding-based graph formation model. Different from existing graph representation learning, where link generation probabilities are defined as a simple function of the corresponding node embeddings, we model the link generation as a mixture model of the two factors. In addition, we model the homophily factor in spherical space and the influence factor in hyperbolic space to accommodate the fact that (1) homophily results in cycles and (2) influence results in hierarchies in networks. We also design a special projection to align these two spaces. We call this model Non-Euclidean Mixture Model, i.e., NMM. We further integrate NMM with our non-Euclidean graph variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, NMM-GNN. NMM-GNN learns embeddings through a unified framework which uses non-Euclidean GNN encoders, non-Euclidean Gaussian priors, a non-Euclidean decoder, and a novel space unification loss component to unify distinct non-Euclidean geometric spaces. Experiments on public datasets show NMM-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on social network generation and classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to better explain how the social network is formed.</p>

                        <p><p>Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model.</p>

Methods have been proposed that either use logit information directly or that process the model's penultimate layer activations. With "WeiPer", we introduce perturbations of the class projections in the final fully connected layer which creates a richer representation of the input. We show that this simple trick can improve the OOD detection performance of a variety of methods and additionally propose a distance-based method that leverages the properties of the augmented WeiPer space. We achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection results across multiple benchmarks of the OpenOOD framework, especially pronounced in difficult settings in which OOD samples are positioned close to the training set distribution. We support our findings with theoretical motivations and empirical observations, and run extensive ablations to provide insights into why WeiPer works.

However, our theoretical understanding of why and when it works remains limited. Prior work has offered generalization analysis of adversarial training, but they are either restricted to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime or they make restrictive assumptions about data such as (noisy) linear separability or robust realizability. In this work, we study the stability and generalization of adversarial training for two-layer networks <strong>without any data distribution assumptions</strong> and <strong>beyond the NTK regime</strong>. Our findings suggest that for networks with <em>any given initialization</em> and <em>sufficiently large width</em>, the generalization bound can be effectively controlled via early stopping. We further improve the generalization bound by leveraging smoothing using Moreau’s envelope.</p>

                        <p><p>Domain generalization methods aim to learn transferable knowledge from source domains that can generalize well to unseen target domains. Recent studies show that neural networks frequently suffer from a simplicity-biased learning behavior which leads to over-reliance on specific frequency sets, namely as frequency shortcuts, instead of semantic information, resulting in poor generalization performance. Despite previous data augmentation techniques successfully enhancing generalization performances, they intend to apply more frequency shortcuts, thereby causing hallucinations of generalization improvement.In this paper, we aim to prevent such learning behavior of applying frequency shortcuts from a data-driven perspective. Given the theoretical justification of models' biased learning behavior on different spatial frequency components, which is based on the dataset frequency properties, we argue that the learning behavior on various frequency components could be manipulated by changing the dataset statistical structure in the Fourier domain. Intuitively, as frequency shortcuts are hidden in the dominant and highly dependent frequencies of dataset structure, dynamically perturbating the over-reliance frequency components could prevent the application of frequency shortcuts.To this end, we propose two effective data augmentation modules designed to collaboratively and adaptively adjust the frequency characteristic of the dataset, aiming to dynamically influence the learning behavior of the model and ultimately serving as a strategy to mitigate shortcut learning. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

                        <p><p>Fine-tuning on task-specific question-answer pairs is a predominant method for enhancing the performance of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, in certain specialized domains, such as healthcare or harmless content generation, it is nearly impossible to obtain a large volume of high-quality data that matches the downstream distribution. To improve the performance of LLMs in data-scarce domains with domain-mismatched data, we re-evaluated the Transformer architecture and discovered that not all parameter updates during fine-tuning contribute positively to downstream performance. Our analysis reveals that within the self-attention and feed-forward networks, only the fine-tuned attention parameters are particularly beneficial when the training set's distribution does not fully align with the test set. Based on this insight, we propose an effective inference-time intervention method: \uline{T}raining \uline{A}ll parameters but \uline{I}nferring with only \uline{A}ttention (TAIA). We empirically validate TAIA using two general instruction-tuning datasets and evaluate it on seven downstream tasks involving math, reasoning, and knowledge understanding across LLMs of different parameter sizes and fine-tuning techniques. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TAIA achieves superior improvements compared to both the fully fine-tuned model and the base model in most scenarios, with significant performance gains. The high tolerance of TAIA to data mismatches makes it resistant to jailbreaking tuning and enhances specialized tasks using general data.

                        <p><p>Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (\eg colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

Instilling such principles (i.e., a constitution) into a model is resource-intensive, technically challenging, and generally requires human preference labels or examples. We introduce SAMI, an iterative algorithm that finetunes a pretrained language model (without requiring preference labels or demonstrations) to increase the conditional mutual information between constitutions and self-generated responses given queries from a dataset. On single-turn dialogue and summarization, a SAMI-trained mistral-7b outperforms the initial pretrained model, with win rates between 66% and 77%. Strikingly, it also surpasses an instruction-finetuned baseline (mistral-7b-instruct) with win rates between 55% and 57% on single-turn dialogue. SAMI requires a model that writes the principles. To avoid dependence on strong models for writing principles, we align a strong pretrained model (mixtral-8x7b) using constitutions written by a weak instruction-finetuned model (mistral-7b-instruct), achieving a 65% win rate on summarization. Finally, we investigate whether SAMI generalizes to diverse summarization principles (e.g., "summaries should be scientific") and scales to stronger models (llama3-70b), finding that it achieves win rates of up to 68% for learned and 67% for held-out principles compared to the base model. Our results show that a pretrained LM can learn to follow constitutions without using preference labels, demonstrations, or human oversight.</p>

                        <p><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been increasingly adopted to mitigate the high costs and complexity associated with labeling individual instances, learning instead from bags of instances labeled at the bag level and enabling instance-level labeling. While existing research has primarily focused on the learnability of MIL at the bag level, there is an absence of theoretical exploration to check if a given MIL algorithm is learnable at the instance level. This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory to assess the instance-level learnability of deep multiple instance learning (Deep MIL) algorithms. Our analysis exposes significant gaps between current Deep MIL algorithms, highlighting the theoretical conditions that must be satisfied by MIL algorithms to ensure instance-level learnability. With these conditions, we interpret the learnability of the representative Deep MIL algorithms and validate them through empirical studies.</p>

                        <p><p>In this article, we study the behaviour of continuous-time gradient methods on a two-layer linear network with square loss. A dichotomy between SGD and GD is revealed: GD preserves the rank at initialization while (label noise) SGD diminishes the rank regardless of the initialization. We demonstrate this rank deficiency by studying the time evolution of the <em>determinant</em> of a matrix of parameters. To further understand this phenomenon, we derive the stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing the eigenvalues of the parameter matrix. This SDE unveils a <em>replusive force</em> between the eigenvalues: a key regularization mechanism which induces rank deficiency. Our results are well supported by experiments illustrating the phenomenon beyond linear networks and regression tasks.</p>

                        <p><p>To improve performance in contemporary deep learning, one is interested in scaling up the neural network in terms of both the number and the size of the layers. When ramping up the width of a single layer, graceful scaling of training has been linked to the need to normalize the weights and their updates in the "natural norm" particular to that layer. In this paper, we significantly generalize this idea by defining the modular norm, which is the natural norm on the full weight space of any neural network architecture. The modular norm is defined recursively in tandem with the network architecture itself. We show that the modular norm has several promising applications. On the practical side, the modular norm can be used to normalize the updates of any base optimizer so that the learning rate becomes transferable across width and depth. This means that the user does not need to compute optimizer-specific scale factors in order to scale training. On the theoretical side, we show that for any neural network built from "well-behaved" atomic modules, the gradient of the network is Lipschitz-continuous in the modular norm, with the Lipschitz constant admitting a simple recursive formula. This characterization opens the door to porting standard ideas in optimization theory over to deep learning. We have created a Python package called Modula that automatically normalizes weight updates in the modular norm of the architecture. Both the Modula package and code for our experiments are provided in the supplementary material.</p>

We consider the asymptotic limit where the input dimensionand the network width are proportionally large. Recent work [Cui et al., 2023]established that linear regression provides Bayes-optimal test error to learn sucha function when the number of available samples is only linear in the dimension.That work stressed the open challenge of theoretically analyzing the optimal testerror in the more interesting regime where the number of samples is quadratic inthe dimension. In this paper, we solve this challenge for quadratic activations andderive a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error. We also provide analgorithm, that we call GAMP-RIE, which combines approximate message passingwith rotationally invariant matrix denoising, and that asymptotically achieves theoptimal performance. Technically, our result is enabled by establishing a linkwith recent works on optimal denoising of extensive-rank matrices and on theellipsoid fitting problem. We further show empirically that, in the absence ofnoise, randomly-initialized gradient descent seems to sample the space of weights,leading to zero training loss, and averaging over initialization leads to a test errorequal to the Bayes-optimal one.</p>

                        <p>Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a>1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.</p>

                        <p>When training deep neural networks, a model's generalization error is often observed to follow a power scaling law dependent both on the model size and the data size. Perhaps the best known example of such scaling laws are for transformer-based large language models (**LLMs**), where networks with billions of parameters are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Yet, despite sustained widespread interest, a rigorous understanding of why transformer scaling laws exist is still missing. To answer this question, we establish novel statistical estimation and mathematical approximation theories for transformers when the input data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory predicts a power law between the generalization error and both the training data size and the network size for transformers, where the power depends on the intrinsic dimension $d$ of the training data. Notably, the constructed model architecture is shallow, requiring only logarithmic depth in $d$. By leveraging low-dimensional data structures under a manifold hypothesis, we are able to explain transformer scaling laws in a way which respects the data geometry.  Moreover, we test our theory with empirical observation by training LLMs on natural language datasets. We find the observed empirical scaling laws closely agree with our theoretical predictions. Taken together, these results rigorously show the intrinsic dimension of data to be a crucial quantity affecting transformer scaling laws in both theory and practice.</p>

                        <p><p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted significant attention for its effectiveness in improving generalization across various tasks. However, its underlying principles remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze SAM’s training dynamics using the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness and propose a third-order stochastic differential equation (SDE), which reveals that the dynamics are driven by a complex mixture of second- and third-order terms. We show that alignment between the perturbation vector and the top eigenvector is crucial for SAM’s effectiveness in regularizing sharpness, but find that this alignment is often inadequate in practice, which limits SAM's efficiency. Building on these insights, we introduce Eigen-SAM, an algorithm that explicitly aims to regularize the top Hessian eigenvalue by aligning the perturbation vector with the leading eigenvector. We validate the effectiveness of our theory and the practical advantages of our proposed approach through comprehensive experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/RitianLuo/EigenSAM.</p>

                        <p><p>The remarkable capability of over-parameterised neural networks to generalise effectively has been explained by invoking a ``simplicity bias'': neural networks prevent overfitting by initially learning simple classifiers before progressing to more complex, non-linear functions. While simplicity biases have been described theoretically and experimentally in feed-forward networks for supervised learning, the extent to which they also explain the remarkable success of transformers trained with self-supervised techniques remains unclear. In our study, we demonstrate that transformers, trained on natural language data, also display a simplicity bias. Specifically, they sequentially learn many-body interactions among input tokens, reaching a saturation point in the prediction error for low-degree interactions while continuing to learn high-degree interactions.  To conduct this analysis, we develop a procedure to generate \textit{clones} of a given natural language data set, which rigorously capture the interactions between tokens up to a specified order. This approach opens up the possibilities of studying how interactions of different orders in the data affect learning, in natural language processing and beyond.</p>

                        <p><p>Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional defined over the space of probability distributions. MFLD has gained attention due to its connection with noisy gradient descent for mean-field two-layer neural networks. Unlike standard Langevin dynamics, the nonlinearity of the objective functional induces particle interactions, necessitating multiple particles to approximate the dynamics in a finite-particle setting. Recent works (Chen et al., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2023b) have demonstrated the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for MFLD, showing that the gap between the particle system and its mean-field limit uniformly shrinks over time as the number of particles increases. In this work, we improve the dependence on logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) constants in their particle approximation errors, which can exponentially deteriorate with the regularization coefficient. Specifically, we establish an LSI-constant-free particle approximation error concerning the objective gap by leveraging the problem structure in risk minimization. As the application, we demonstrate improved convergence of MFLD, sampling guarantee for the mean-field stationary distribution, and uniform-in-time Wasserstein propagation of chaos in terms of particle complexity.</p>

It was inspired by episodic memory on the functional level, but lacks a direct theoretical connection to the associative memory models generally used to implement such a memory. We first show that the dictionary is an instance of the recently proposed Universal Hopfield Network framework. We then introduce a continuous approximation of the dictionary readout operation in order to derive two energy functions that are Lyapunov functions of the dynamics. Finally, we empirically show that the dictionary outperforms the Max separation function, which had previously been argued to be optimal, and that performance can further be improved by replacing the Euclidean distance kernel by a Manhattan distance kernel. These results are enabled by the generalization capabilities of the dictionary, so a novel criterion is introduced to disentangle memorization from generalization when evaluating associative memory models.</p>

However, existing theoretical results are restricted to either linear models, the last two layers or binary classification. In contrast, we focus on non-linear models of arbitrary depth in multi-class classification and reveal a surprising qualitative shift. As soon as we go beyond two layers or two classes, DNC stops being optimal for the deep unconstrained features model (DUFM) -- the standard theoretical framework for the analysis of collapse. The main culprit is the low-rank bias of multi-layer regularization schemes. This bias leads to optimal solutions of even lower rank than the neural collapse. We support our theoretical findings with experiments on both DUFM and real data, which show the emergence of the low-rank structure in the solution found by gradient descent.</p>

Besides, it can  also provide key insights into the optimization landscape of neural networks. In the context of deep neural networks, understanding the GN matrix involves studying the interaction between different weight matrices as well as the dependencies introduced by the data, thus rendering its analysis challenging.In this work, we take a first step towards theoretically characterizing the conditioning of the GN matrix in neural networks. We establish tight bounds on the condition number of the GN in deep linear networks of arbitrary depth and width, which we also extend to two-layer ReLU networks.We expand the analysis to further architectural components, such as residual connections and convolutional layers. Finally, we empirically validate the bounds and uncover valuable insights into the influence of the analyzed architectural components.</p>

                        <p><p>The neural network memorization problem is to study the expressive power of neural networks to interpolate a finite dataset. Although memorization is widely believed to have a close relationship with the strong generalizability of deep learning when using overparameterized models, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no theoretical study on the generalizability of memorization neural networks. In this paper, we give the first theoretical analysis of this topic. Since using i.i.d. training data is a necessary condition for a learning algorithm to be generalizable, memorization and its generalization theory for i.i.d. datasets are developed under mild conditions on the data distribution. First, algorithms are given to construct memorization networks for an i.i.d. dataset, which have the smallest number of parameters and even a constant number of parameters. Second, we show that, in order for the memorization networks to be generalizable, the width of the network must be at least equal to the dimension of the data, which implies that the existing memorization networks with an optimal number of parameters are not generalizable. Third, a lower bound for the sample complexity of general memorization algorithms and the exact sample complexity for memorization algorithms with constant number of parameters are given. As a consequence, it is shown that there exist data distributions such that, to be generalizable for them, the memorization network must have an exponential number of parameters in the data dimension. Finally, an efficient and generalizable memorization algorithm is given when the number of training samples is greater than the efficient memorization sample complexity of the data distribution.</p>

                        <p>Deep learning succeeds by doing hierarchical feature learning, yet tuning hyper-parameters (HP) such as initialization scales, learning rates etc., only give indirect control over this behavior. In this paper, we introduce a key notion to predict and control feature learning: the angle $\theta_\ell$ between the feature updates and the backward pass (at layer index $\ell$). We show that the magnitude of feature updates after one GD step, at any training time, can be expressed via a simple and general *feature speed formula* in terms of this angle $\theta_\ell$, the loss decay, and the magnitude of the backward pass. This angle $\theta_\ell$ is controlled by the conditioning of the layer-to-layer Jacobians and at random initialization, it is determined by the spectrum of a certain kernel, which coincides with the Neural Tangent Kernel when $\ell=\text{depth}$. Given $\theta_\ell$, the feature speed formula provides us with rules to adjust HPs (scales and learning rates) so as to satisfy certain dynamical properties, such as feature learning and loss decay. We investigate the implications of our approach for ReLU MLPs and ResNets in the large width-then-depth limit. Relying on prior work, we show that in ReLU MLPs with iid initialization, the angle degenerates with depth as $\cos(\theta_\ell)=\Theta(1/\sqrt{\ell})$. In contrast, ResNets with branch scale  $O(1/\sqrt{\text{depth}})$ maintain a non-degenerate angle $\cos(\theta_\ell)=\Theta(1)$. We use these insights to recover key properties of known HP scalings (such as $\mu$P), and also introduce a new HP scaling for large depth ReLU MLPs with favorable theoretical properties.</p>

                        <p><p>Worldwide geolocalization aims to locate the precise location at the coordinate level of photos taken anywhere on the Earth. It is very challenging due to 1) the difficulty of capturing subtle location-aware visual semantics, and 2) the heterogeneous geographical distribution of image data. As a result, existing studies have clear limitations when scaled to a worldwide context. They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot adapt to various locations worldwide with different amounts of relevant data. To resolve these limitations, we propose <strong>G3</strong>, a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In particular, G3 consists of three steps, i.e., <strong>G</strong>eo-alignment, <strong>G</strong>eo-diversification, and <strong>G</strong>eo-verification to optimize both retrieval and generation phases of worldwide geolocalization. During Geo-alignment, our solution jointly learns expressive multi-modal representations for images, GPS and textual descriptions, which allows us to capture location-aware semantics for retrieving nearby images for a given query. During Geo-diversification, we leverage a prompt ensembling method that is robust to inconsistent retrieval performance for different image queries. Finally, we combine both retrieved and generated GPS candidates in Geo-verification for location prediction. Experiments on two well-established datasets IM2GPS3k and YFCC4k verify the superiority of G3 compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

                        <p>Transformer models can face practical limitations due to their high computational requirements. At the same time, such models exhibit significant activation sparsity, which can be leveraged to reduce the inference cost by converting parts of the network into equivalent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. Despite the crucial role played by activation sparsity, its impact on this process remains unexplored. We demonstrate that the efficiency of the conversion can be significantly enhanced by a proper regularization of the activation sparsity of the base model. Moreover, motivated by the high variance of the number of activated neurons for different inputs, we introduce a more effective dynamic-$k$ expert selection rule that adjusts the number of executed experts on a per-token basis. To achieve further savings, we extend this approach to multi-head attention projections. Finally, we develop an efficient implementation that translates these computational savings into actual wall-clock speedup. The proposed method, Dense to Dynamic-$k$ Mixture-of-Experts (D2DMoE), outperforms existing approaches on common NLP and vision tasks, reducing inference cost by up to 60\% without significantly impacting performance.</p>

Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</p>

                        <p><p>Subset selection tasks, such as anomaly detection and compound selection in AI-assisted drug discovery, are crucial for a wide range of applications. Learning subset-valued functions with neural networks has achieved great success by incorporating permutation invariance symmetry into the architecture. However, existing neural set architectures often struggle to either capture comprehensive information from the superset or address complex interactions within the input. Additionally, they often fail to perform in scenarios where superset sizes surpass available memory capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel concept of the Identity Property, which requires models to integrate information from the originating set, resulting in the development of neural networks that excel at performing effective subset selection from large supersets. Moreover, we present the Hierarchical Representation of Neural Subset Selection (HORSE), an attention-based method that learns complex interactions and retains information from both the input set and the optimal subset supervision signal. Specifically, HORSE enables the partitioning of the input ground set into manageable chunks that can be processed independently and then aggregated, ensuring consistent outcomes across different partitions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HORSE significantly enhances neural subset selection performance by capturing more complex information and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in handling large-scale inputs by a margin of up to 20%.</p>

                        <p><p>We present Preference Flow Matching (PFM), a new framework for preference alignment that streamlines the integration of preferences into an arbitrary class of pre-trained models. Existing alignment methods require fine-tuning pre-trained models, which presents challenges such as scalability, inefficiency, and the need for model modifications, especially with black-box APIs like GPT-4. In contrast, PFM utilizes flow matching techniques to directly learn from preference data, thereby reducing the dependency on extensive fine-tuning of pre-trained models. By leveraging flow-based models, PFM transforms less preferred data into preferred outcomes, and effectively aligns model outputs with human preferences without relying on explicit or implicit reward function estimation, thus avoiding common issues like overfitting in reward models. We provide theoretical insights that support our method’s alignment with standard preference alignment objectives. Experimental results indicate the practical effectiveness of our method, offering a new direction in aligning a pre-trained model to preference.

While on-device inference is a well-explored topic in recent research, backpropagation remains an open challenge due to its prohibitive computational and memory costs compared to the extreme resource constraints of embedded devices. Drawing on tensor decomposition research, we tackle the main bottleneck of backpropagation, namely the memory footprint of activation map storage. We investigate and compare the effects of activation compression using Singular Value Decomposition and its tensor variant, High-Order Singular Value Decomposition. The application of low-order decomposition results in considerable memory savings while preserving the features essential for learning, and also offers theoretical guarantees to convergence. Experimental results obtained on main-stream architectures and tasks demonstrate Pareto-superiority over other state-of-the-art solutions, in terms of the trade-off between generalization and memory footprint.</p>

Federated learning (FL) further enhances fine-tuning in a privacy-aware manner by utilizing clients' local data through in-situ computation, eliminating the need for data movement. However, fine-tuning LLMs, given their massive scale of parameters, poses challenges for clients with constrained and heterogeneous resources in FL. Previous methods employed low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient federated fine-tuning but utilized traditional FL aggregation strategies on LoRA adapters. This approach led to mathematically inaccurate aggregation noise, reducing fine-tuning effectiveness and failing to address heterogeneous LoRAs. In this work, we first highlight the mathematical incorrectness of LoRA aggregation in existing federated fine-tuning methods. We introduce a new approach called FLoRA that enables federated fine-tuning on heterogeneous LoRA adapters across clients through a novel stacking-based aggregation method. Our approach is noise-free and seamlessly supports heterogeneous LoRAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate FLoRA's superior performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. We envision this work as a milestone for efficient, privacy-preserving, and accurate federated fine-tuning of LLMs.</p>

To this end, we release ChessBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset of 10 million chess games with legal move and value annotations (15 billion data points)  provided by Stockfish 16, the state-of-the-art chess engine. We train transformers with up to 270 million parameters on ChessBench via supervised learning and perform extensive ablations to assess the impact of dataset size, model size, architecture type, and different prediction targets (state-values, action-values, and behavioral cloning). Our largest models learn to predict action-values for novel boards quite accurately, implying highly non-trivial generalization. Despite performing no explicit search, our resulting chess policy solves challenging chess puzzles and achieves a surprisingly strong Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans (grandmaster level). We also compare to Leela Chess Zero and AlphaZero (trained without supervision via self-play) with and without search. We show that, although a remarkably good approximation of Stockfish’s search-based algorithm can be distilled into large-scale transformers via supervised learning, perfect distillation is still beyond reach, thus making ChessBench well-suited for future research.</p>

Despite its widespread usage and being extensively studied in the classical literature, its role remains poorly understood for deep learning. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For deep networks on vision tasks trained with multipass SGD, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the <em>loss stabilization mechanism</em>. In contrast, for large language models trained with nearly one-epoch training, we describe how weight decay balances the <em>bias-variance tradeoff</em> in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss and improved training stability. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way.</p>

                        <p><p>Significant progress has been made in text-to-video generation through the use of powerful generative models and large-scale internet data. However, substantial challenges remain in precisely controlling individual elements within the generated video, such as the movement and appearance of specific characters and the manipulation of viewpoints. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm that generates each element in 3D representation separately and then composites them with priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) and 2D diffusion models. Specifically, given an input textual query, our scheme consists of four stages: 1) we leverage the LLMs as the director to first decompose the complex query into several sub-queries, where each sub-query describes each element of the generated video; 2) to generate each element, pre-trained models are invoked by the LLMs to obtain the corresponding 3D representation; 3) to composite the generated 3D representations, we prompt multi-modal LLMs to produce coarse guidance on the scale, location, and trajectory of different objects; 4) to make the results adhere to natural distribution, we further leverage 2D diffusion priors and use score distillation sampling to refine the composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity videos from text with flexible control over each element.</p>

                        <p><p>The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparse-that can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparseindices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of longcontext LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. Byevaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM-4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

                        <p><p>Internet of Things (IoT) sensing models often suffer from overfitting due to data distribution shifts between training dataset and real-world scenarios. To address this, data augmentation techniques have been adopted to enhance model robustness by bolstering the diversity of synthetic samples within a defined vicinity of existing samples. This paper introduces a novel paradigm of data augmentation for IoT sensing signals by adding fine-grained control to generative models. We define a metric space with statistical metrics that capture the essential features of the short-time Fourier transformed (STFT) spectrograms of IoT sensing signals. These metrics serve as strong conditions for a generative model, enabling us to tailor the spectrogram characteristics in the time-frequency domain according to specific application needs. Furthermore, we propose a set of data augmentation techniques within this metric space to create new data samples. Our method is evaluated across various generative models, datasets, and downstream IoT sensing models. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the conventional transformation-based data augmentation techniques and prior generative data augmentation models.</p>

However, the optimal design of these linear models is still an open question. In this work, we attempt to answer this question by finding the best linear approximation to softmax attention from a theoretical perspective. We start by unifying existing linear complexity models as the linear attention form and then identify three conditions for the optimal linear attention design: (1) Dynamic memory ability; (2) Static approximation ability; (3) Least parameter approximation. We find that none of the current linear models meet all three conditions, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose Meta Linear Attention (MetaLA) as a solution that satisfies these conditions. Our experiments on Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) task, language modeling, image classification, and Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate that MetaLA is more effective than the existing linear models.</p>

In this paper, we explore the potential of deliberately designing force fields for Hamiltonian systems, introducing Hamiltonian velocity predictors (HVPs) as a core tool for constructing energy-based and generative models. We present two innovations: Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM), which utilizes score functions to augment data by simulating Hamiltonian trajectories, and Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs), a novel generative model that encompasses diffusion models and OT-flow matching as HGFs with zero force fields. We showcase the extended design space of force fields by introducing Oscillation HGFs, a generative model inspired by harmonic oscillators. Our experiments demonstrate that HSM and HGFs rival leading score-matching and generative modeling techniques. Overall, our work systematically elucidates the synergy between Hamiltonian dynamics, force fields, and generative models, thereby opening new avenues for applications of machine learning in physical sciences and dynamical systems.</p>

                        <p>Recent 3D large reconstruction models (LRMs) can generate high-quality 3D content in sub-seconds by integrating multi-view diffusion models with scalable multi-view reconstructors. Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (\eg, Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity.With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content generation scenarios with approximately only $0.1\times$ of the model size.

                        <p><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data.However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations – realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images.Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application.This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff.We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms.This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p>

                        <p><p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output even undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the issue as the distributional shift and uncertainty of human preference in dataset. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm which optimizes the policy against an adversarially chosen reward model, one that simultaneously minimizes its MLE loss and a reward penalty term. The penalty pessimistically biases the uncertain rewards so as to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spursiouly high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy to implement form. With a clever usage of the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss which explicitly imitates the policy with a baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fune-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO).Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of our method when compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p>

                        <p>Generative models based on flow matching have attracted significant attention for their simplicity and superior performance in high-resolution image synthesis. By leveraging the instantaneous change-of-variables formula, one can directly compute image likelihoods from a learned flow, making them enticing candidates as priors for downstream tasks such as inverse problems. In particular, a natural approach would be to incorporate such image probabilities in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. A major obstacle, however, lies in the slow computation of the log-likelihood, as it requires backpropagating through an ODE solver, which can be prohibitively slow for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an iterative algorithm to approximate the MAP estimator efficiently to solve a variety of linear inverse problems. Our algorithm is mathematically justified by the observation that the MAP objective can be approximated by a sum of $N$ ``local MAP'' objectives, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, we show that we can perform gradient steps to sequentially optimize these objectives. We validate our approach for various linear inverse problems, such as super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and compressed sensing, and demonstrate that we can outperform other methods based on flow matching.

However, the immense scale of the chemical space makes it challenging to explore all possible materials experimentally. In this paper, we introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models (LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline materials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base distribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting to a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and iteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for stable, unique, and novel crystals by $\sim50$% – a huge improvement on a difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model, significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.</p>

                        <p><p>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, while preserving user data privacy. Despite its potential, standard FL algorithms lack support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which vary significantly in model and dataset sizes---from small IoT devices to large workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge effectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied capabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of informative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones, and the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all devices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique contributions of each device. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel KD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device prototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to preserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a KD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the noisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the separately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic knowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the knowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present theoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in transferring knowledge across heterogeneous device prototypes with varying capacities. Comprehensive evaluations of our method across both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks demonstrate that TAKFL achieves state-of-the-art results in a variety of datasets and settings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods.

                        <p><p>The recently introduced Consistency models pose an efficient alternative to diffusion algorithms, enabling rapid and good quality image synthesis. These methods overcome the slowness of diffusion models by directly mapping noise to data, while maintaining a (relatively) simpler training. Consistency models enable a fast one- or few-step generation, but they typically fall somewhat short in sample quality when compared to their diffusion origins. In this work we propose a novel and highly effective technique for post-processing Consistency-based generated images, enhancing their perceptual quality. Our approach utilizes a joint classifier-discriminator model, in which both portions are trained adversarially. While the classifier aims to grade an image based on its assignment to a designated class, the discriminator portion of the very same network leverages the softmax values to assess the proximity of the input image to the targeted data manifold, thereby serving as an Energy-based Model. By employing example-specific projected gradient iterations under the guidance of this joint machine, we refine synthesized images and achieve an improved FID scores on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset for both Consistency-Training and Consistency-Distillation techniques.</p>

                        <p><p>Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation tasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of self-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

                        <p><p>Instruction tuning is a supervised fine-tuning approach that significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. For programming tasks, most models are finetuned with costly human-annotated instruction-response pairs or those generated by large, proprietary LLMs, which may not be permitted. We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent and permissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive human annotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model for inference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diverse coding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It then samples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validates them in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected for instruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign with CodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs. Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller. Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms the original version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art method for instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally, we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3B to 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their own data distribution. We further validate each component’s effectiveness in our pipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation from GPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation of StarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, and self-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance. Overall, SelfCodeAlign shows for the first time that a strong instruction-tuned code LLM can result from self-alignment rather than distillation.</p>

In this work, we develop a novel weight quantization method that quantizes the UNet from Stable Diffusion v1.5 to $1.99$ bits, achieving a model with $7.9\times$ smaller size while exhibiting even better generation quality than the original one. Our approach includes several novel techniques, such as assigning optimal bits to each layer, initializing the quantized model for better performance, and improving the training strategy to dramatically reduce quantization error.

                        <p><p>Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DMMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However, these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for high-dimensional data-rich problems, including DDMs-based Rectified Flow and Schrodinger bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schrodinger bridge, a dynamic entropy-regularized version of OT, that eliminates the need to train multiple DDMs-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretization of a flow of path measures, referred to as the Schrodinger Bridge Flow, whose only stationary point is the Schrodinger bridge. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.</p>

                        <p><p>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its utility in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from some current source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, we argue that these methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution.We show that by calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution, we can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-to-3D, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.</p>

                        <p>Through an uncertainty quantification (UQ) perspective, we show that score-based generative models (SGMs) are provably robust to the multiple sources of error in practical implementation. Our primary tool is the Wasserstein uncertainty propagation (WUP) theorem, a *model-form UQ* bound that describes how the $L^2$ error from learning the score function propagates to a Wasserstein-1 ($\mathbf{d}_1$) ball around the true data distribution under the evolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. We show how errors due to (a) finite sample approximation, (b) early stopping, (c) score-matching objective choice, (d) score function parametrization expressiveness, and (e) reference distribution choice, impact the quality of the generative model in terms of a $\mathbf{d}_1$ bound of computable quantities. The WUP theorem relies on Bernstein estimates for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations (PDE) and the regularizing properties of diffusion processes. Specifically, *PDE regularity theory* shows that *stochasticity* is the key mechanism ensuring SGM algorithms are provably robust. The WUP theorem applies to integral probability metrics beyond $\mathbf{d}_1$, such as the total variation distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. Sample complexity and generalization bounds in $\mathbf{d}_1$ follow directly from the WUP theorem. Our approach requires minimal assumptions, is agnostic to the manifold hypothesis and avoids absolute continuity assumptions for the target distribution. Additionally, our results clarify the *trade-offs* among multiple error sources in SGMs.</p>

                        <p><p>Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced high-dimensional data generation across various domains, by learning a denoising oracle (or score) from datasets. From a Bayesian perspective, they offer a realistic modeling of data priors and facilitate solving inverse problems through posterior sampling. Although many heuristic methods have been developed recently for this purpose, they lack the quantitative guarantees needed in many scientific applications. This work addresses the topic from two perspectives. We first present a hardness result indicating that a generic method leveraging the prior denoising oracle for posterior sampling becomes infeasible as soon as the measurement operator is mildly ill-conditioned. We next develop the <em>tilted transport</em> technique, which leverages the quadratic structure of the log-likelihood in linear inverse problems in combination with the prior denoising oracle to exactly transform the original posterior sampling problem into a new one that is provably easier to sample from. We quantify the conditions under which the boosted posterior is strongly log-concave, highlighting how task difficulty depends on the condition number of the measurement matrix and the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting general scheme is shown to match the best-known sampling methods for Ising models, and is further validated on high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models.</p>

To address this problem, incorporating well-shot personal images as additional reference inputs may be a promising strategy. Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) in image generation, we propose ReF-LDM—an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our LDM-based model incorporates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, for conditioning on reference images. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling LDM to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces. Lastly, we construct FFHQ-ref, a dataset consisting of 20,406 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.</p>

                        <p><p>Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

                        <p><p>We introduce GrounDiT, a novel training-free spatial grounding technique for text-to-image generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Spatial grounding with bounding boxes has gained attention for its simplicity and versatility, allowing for enhanced user control in image generation. However, prior training-free approaches often rely on updating the noisy image during the reverse diffusion process via backpropagation from custom loss functions, which frequently struggle to provide precise control over individual bounding boxes. In this work, we leverage the flexibility of the Transformer architecture, demonstrating that DiT can generate noisy patches corresponding to each bounding box, fully encoding the target object and allowing for fine-grained control over each region. Our approach builds on an intriguing property of DiT, which we refer to as semantic sharing. Due to semantic sharing, when a smaller patch is jointly denoised alongside a generatable-size image, the two become semantic clones. Each patch is denoised in its own branch of the generation process and then transplanted into the corresponding region of the original noisy image at each timestep, resulting in robust spatial grounding for each bounding box. In our experiments on the HRS and DrawBench benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to previous training-free approaches. Project Page: https://groundit-diffusion.github.io/.</p>

                        <p><p>Real-world offline datasets are often subject to data corruptions (such as noise or adversarial attacks) due to sensor failures or malicious attacks. Despite advances in robust offline reinforcement learning (RL), existing methods struggle to learn robust agents under high uncertainty caused by the diverse corrupted data (i.e., corrupted states, actions, rewards, and dynamics), leading to performance degradation in clean environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel robust variational Bayesian inference for offline RL (TRACER). It introduces Bayesian inference for the first time to capture the uncertainty via offline data for robustness against all types of data corruptions. Specifically, TRACER first models all corruptions as the uncertainty in the action-value function. Then, to capture such uncertainty, it uses all offline data as the observations to approximate the posterior distribution of the action-value function under a Bayesian inference framework. An appealing feature of TRACER is that it can distinguish corrupted data from clean data using an entropy-based uncertainty measure, since corrupted data often induces higher uncertainty and entropy. Based on the aforementioned measure, TRACER can regulate the loss associated with corrupted data to reduce its influence, thereby enhancing robustness and performance in clean environments. Experiments demonstrate that TRACER significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches across both individual and simultaneous data corruptions.</p>

                        <p><p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in creating images from text descriptions. However, these T2I generation models often fail to generate images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects. In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging. First, SELMA leverages an LLM’s in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts. Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging. Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets. We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation. Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models.

                        <p><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation due to their outstanding capabilities. However, these models require substantial computing resources because of the multi-step denoising process during inference. While traditional pruning methods have been employed to optimize these models, the retraining process necessitates large-scale training datasets and extensive computational costs to maintain generalization ability, making it neither convenient nor efficient. Recent studies attempt to utilize the similarity of features across adjacent denoising stages to reduce computational costs through simple and static strategies. However, these strategies cannot fully harness the potential of the similar feature patterns across adjacent timesteps. In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that derives an efficient diffusion model via a more intelligent and differentiable pruner. At the core of our approach is casting the model pruning process into a SubNet search process. Specifically, we first introduce a SuperNet based on standard diffusion via adding some backup connections built upon the similar features. We then construct a plugin pruner network and design optimization losses to identify redundant computation. Finally, our method can identify an optimal SubNet through few-step gradient optimization and a simple post-processing procedure. We conduct extensive experiments on various diffusion models including Stable Diffusion series and DiTs. Our DiP-GO approach achieves 4.4 x speedup for SD-1.5 without any loss of accuracy, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                        <p>Diffusion models (DMs) have been significantly developed and widely used in various applications due to their excellent generative qualities. However, the expensive computation and massive parameters of DMs hinder their practical use in resource-constrained scenarios. As one of the effective compression approaches, quantization allows DMs to achieve storage saving and inference acceleration by reducing bit-width while maintaining generation performance.  However, as the most extreme quantization form, 1-bit binarization causes the generation performance of DMs to face severe degradation or even collapse. This paper proposes a novel method, namely BiDM, for fully binarizing weights and activations of DMs, pushing quantization to the 1-bit limit. From a temporal perspective, we introduce the Timestep-friendly Binary Structure (TBS), which uses learnable activation binarizers and cross-timestep feature connections to address the highly timestep-correlated activation features of DMs. From a spatial perspective, we propose Space Patched Distillation (SPD) to address the difficulty of matching binary features during distillation, focusing on the spatial locality of image generation tasks and noise estimation networks. As the first work to fully binarize DMs, the W1A1 BiDM on the LDM-4 model for LSUN-Bedrooms 256$\times$256 achieves a remarkable FID of 22.74, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art general binarization methods with an FID of 59.44 and invalid generative samples, and achieves up to excellent 28.0 times storage and 52.7 times OPs savings.</p>

                        <p><p>Diffusion models have gained traction as powerful algorithms for synthesizing high-quality images. Central to these algorithms is the diffusion process, a set of equations which maps data to noise in a way that can significantly affect performance. In this paper, we explore whether the diffusionprocess can be learned from data.Our work is grounded in Bayesian inference and seeks to improve log-likelihood estimation by casting the learned diffusion process as an approximate variational posterior that yields a tighter lower bound (ELBO) on the likelihood.A widely held assumption is that the ELBO is invariant to the noise process: our work dispels this assumption and proposes multivariate learned adaptive noise (MuLAN), a learned diffusion process that applies noise at different rates across an image. Our method consists of three components: a multivariate noise schedule, adaptive input-conditional diffusion, and auxiliary variables; these components ensure that the ELBO is no longer invariant to the choice of the noise schedule as in previous works.  Empirically, MuLAN sets a new <strong>state-of-the-art</strong> in density estimation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while matching the performance of previous state-of-the-art models with <strong>50%</strong> fewer steps.  We provide the code, along with a blog post and video tutorial on the project page: https://s-sahoo.com/MuLAN</p>

                        <p><p>Modern diffusion-based image generative models have made significant progress and become promising to enrich training data for the object detection task. However, the generation quality and the controllability for complex scenes containing multi-class objects and dense objects with occlusions remain limited. This paper presents ODGEN, a novel method to generate high-quality images conditioned on bounding boxes, thereby facilitating data synthesis for object detection. Given a domain-specific object detection dataset, we first fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model on both cropped foreground objects and entire images to fit target distributions. Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. In addition, we design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods.</p>

                        <p><p>With the rapidly increasing number of satellites in space and their enhanced capabilities, the amount of earth observation images collected by satellites is exceeding the transmission limits of satellite-to-ground links. Although existing learned image compression solutions achieve remarkable performance by using a sophisticated encoder to extract fruitful features as compression and using a decoder to reconstruct. It is still hard to directly deploy those complex encoders on current satellites' embedded GPUs with limited computing capability and power supply to compress images in orbit. In this paper, we propose COSMIC, a simple yet effective learned compression solution to transmit satellite images. We first design a lightweight encoder (i.e. reducing FLOPs by 2.5~5X) on satellite to achieve a high image compression ratio to save satellite-to-ground links. Then, for reconstructions on the ground, to deal with the feature extraction ability degradation due to simplifying encoders, we propose a diffusion-based model to compensate image details when decoding. Our insight is that satellite's earth observation photos are not just images but indeed multi-modal data with a nature of Text-to-Image pairing since they are collected with rich sensor data (e.g. coordinates, timestep, etc.) that can be used as the condition for diffusion generation.  Extensive experiments show that COSMIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both perceptual and distortion metrics.</p>

                        <p><p>Lumina-T2X is a nascent family of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) that establishes a unified framework for transforming noise into various modalities, such as images and videos, conditioned on text instructions. Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduce a sigmoid time discretization schedule for diffusion sampling, which achieves high-quality generation in 5-10 steps combined with higher-order ODE solvers. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities as well as multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-views, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-T2X, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling.</p>

Inspired by the crucial observation that multi-view inconsistency in scene editing is rooted in the diffusion model’s large feasible output space (FOS), our framework controls the size of FOS and reduces inconsistency by decomposing the overall editing task into several subtasks, which are then executed progressively on the scene. Within this framework, we design a difficulty-aware subtask decomposition scheduler and an adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) training strategy, ensuring high efficiency in performing each subtask. Extensive evaluation shows that our ProEdit achieves state-of-the-art results in various scenes and challenging editing tasks, all through a simple framework without any expensive or sophisticated add-ons like distillation losses, components, or training procedures. Notably, ProEdit also provides a new way to preview, control, and select the aggressivity of editing operation during the editing process.</p>

                        <p><p>Images produced by diffusion models are increasingly popular in digital artwork and visual marketing. However, such generated images might replicate content from existing ones and pose the challenge of content originality. Existing Image Copy Detection (ICD) models, though accurate in detecting hand-crafted replicas, overlook the challenge from diffusion models. This motivates us to introduce ICDiff, the first ICD specialized for diffusion models. To this end, we construct a Diffusion-Replication (D-Rep) dataset and correspondingly propose a novel deep embedding method. D-Rep uses a state-of-the-art diffusion model (Stable Diffusion V1.5) to generate 40, 000 image-replica pairs, which are manually annotated into 6 replication levels ranging from 0 (no replication) to 5 (total replication). Our method, PDF-Embedding, transforms the replication level of each image-replica pair into a probability density function (PDF) as the supervision signal. The intuition is that the probability of neighboring replication levels should be continuous and smooth. Experimental results show that PDF-Embedding surpasses protocol-driven methods and non-PDF choices on the D-Rep test set. Moreover, by utilizing PDF-Embedding, we find that the replication ratios of well-known diffusion models against an open-source gallery range from 10% to 20%. The project is publicly available at https://icdiff.github.io/.</p>

                        <p><p>Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecule generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT has a condition encoder to learn the representation of numerical and categorical properties and utilizes a Transformer-based graph denoiser to achieve molecular graph denoising under conditions. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, we propose a graph-dependent noise model for training Graph DiT, designed to accurately estimate graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate the Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate our superiority across metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its practical utility. The code is available at https://github.com/liugangcode/Graph-DiT.</p>

                        <p><p>Quantization of diffusion models has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to enable various applications on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, given the cumulative nature of quantization errors in quantized diffusion models, overall performance may still decline even with efforts to minimize quantization error at each sampling step.Recent studies have proposed several methods to address accumulated quantization error, yet these solutions often suffer from limited applicability due to their underlying assumptions or only partially resolve the issue due to an incomplete understanding.In this work, we introduce a novel perspective by conceptualizing quantization error as a "stepback" in the denoising process. We investigate how the accumulation of quantization error can distort the sampling trajectory, resulting in a notable decrease in model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce StepbaQ, a method that calibrates the sampling trajectory and counteracts the adverse effects of accumulated quantization error through a sampling step correction mechanism. Notably, StepbaQ relies solely on statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset, highlighting its strong applicability.Our experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique to enhance the performance of diffusion models quantized by off-the-shelf tools without modifying the quantization settings. For example, StepbaQ significantly improves the performance of the quantized SD v1.5 model by 7.30 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the common W8A8 setting, and it enhances the performance of the quantized SDXL-Turbo model by 17.31 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the challenging W4A8 setting.</p>

ICL possesses many distinct characteristics from conventional machine learning, thereby requiring new approaches to interpret this learning paradigm. Taking the viewpoint of recent works showing that transformers learn in context by formulating an internal optimizer, we propose an influence function-based attribution technique, DETAIL, that addresses the specific characteristics of ICL. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach for demonstration attribution while being computationally efficient. Leveraging the results, we then show how DETAIL can help improve model performance in real-world scenarios through demonstration reordering and curation. Finally, we experimentally prove the wide applicability of DETAIL by showing our attribution scores obtained on white-box models are transferable to black-box models in improving model performance.</p>

                        <p><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from a few examples provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples – the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: (1) "Reinforced ICL" that uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human rationales, and (2) "Unsupervised ICL" where we remove rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific inputs. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we reveal the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.</p>

Though this success is often attributed to the Transformer architecture, our systematic understanding is limited. In complex real-world data sets, even defining what is out-of-distribution is not obvious. To better understand the OOD behaviour of autoregressive LLMs, we focus on formal languages, which are defined by the intersection of rules. We define a new scenario of OOD compositional generalization, termed \textit{rule extrapolation}. Rule extrapolation describes OOD scenarios, where the prompt violates at least one rule. We evaluate rule extrapolation in formal languages with varying complexity in linear and recurrent architectures, the Transformer, and state space models to understand the architectures' influence on rule extrapolation. We also lay the first stones of a normative theory of rule extrapolation, inspired by the Solomonoff prior in algorithmic information theory.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper presents a method for estimating the hallucination rate for in-context learning (ICL) with generative AI. In ICL, a conditional generative model (CGM) is prompted with a dataset and a prediction question and asked to generate a response. One interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes the posterior predictive of an unknown Bayesian model, which implicitly defines a joint distribution over observable datasets and latent mechanisms. This joint distribution factorizes into two components: the model prior over mechanisms and the model likelihood of datasets given a mechanism. With this perspective, we define a \textit{hallucination} as a generated response to the prediction question with low model likelihood given the mechanism. We develop a new method that takes an ICL problem and estimates the probability that a CGM will generate a hallucination. Our method only requires generating prediction questions and responses from the CGM and evaluating its response log probability. We empirically evaluate our method using large language models for synthetic regression and natural language ICL tasks.</p>

                        <p><p>The in-context learning (ICL) capability of pre-trained models based on the transformer architecture has received growing interest in recent years. While theoretical understanding has been obtained for ICL in reinforcement learning (RL), the previous results are largely confined to the single-agent setting. This work proposes to further explore the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained transformer models in competitive multi-agent games, i.e., in-context game-playing (ICGP). Focusing on the classical two-player zero-sum games, theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate that pre-trained transformers can provably learn to approximate Nash equilibrium in an in-context manner for both decentralized and centralized learning settings. As a key part of the proof, constructional results are established to demonstrate that the transformer architecture is sufficiently rich to realize celebrated multi-agent game-playing algorithms, in particular, decentralized V-learning and centralized VI-ULCB.</p>

                        <p><p>There are an increasing number of domains in which artificial intelligence (AI) systems both surpass human ability and accurately model human behavior. This introduces the possibility of algorithmically-informed teaching in these domains through more relatable AI partners and deeper insights into human decision-making. Critical to achieving this goal, however, is coherently modeling human behavior at various skill levels. Chess is an ideal model system for conducting research into this kind of human-AI alignment, with its rich history as a pivotal testbed for AI research, mature superhuman AI systems like AlphaZero, and precise measurements of skill via chess rating systems. Previous work in modeling human decision-making in chess uses completely independent models to capture human style at different skill levels, meaning they lack coherence in their ability to adapt to the full spectrum of human improvement and are ultimately limited in their effectiveness as AI partners and teaching tools. In this work, we propose a unified modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve. Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a skill-aware attention mechanism to dynamically integrate players’ strengths with encoded chess positions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill. Our experimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly enhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of expertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making and AI-guided teaching tools.</p>

                        <p><p>Large Reconstruction Models have made significant strides in the realm of automated 3D content generation from single or multiple input images. Despite their success, these models often produce 3D meshes with geometric inaccuracies, stemming from the inherent challenges of deducing 3D shapes solely from image data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, the Large Image and Point Cloud Alignment Model (LAM3D), which utilizes 3D point cloud data to enhance the fidelity of generated 3D meshes. Our methodology begins with the development of a point-cloud-based network that effectively generates precise and meaningful latent tri-planes, laying the groundwork for accurate 3D mesh reconstruction. Building upon this, our Image-Point-Cloud Feature Alignment technique processes a single input image, aligning to the latent tri-planes to imbue image features with robust 3D information. This process not only enriches the image features but also facilitates the production of high-fidelity 3D meshes without the need for multi-view input, significantly reducing geometric distortions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art high-fidelity 3D mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 6 seconds, and experiments on various datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

                        <p><p>The growing safety concerns surrounding large language models raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, typical Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a perspective of dualization that  reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based settings (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our algorithms.</p>

                        <p><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user’s responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization – using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and performing reasoning with the acquired knowledge---\textit{situated inductive reasoning}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. Imagine a scenario: in the United States, you drive on the right side of the road. When you travel to the UK, you might initially find it strange how people drive. However, you soon realize that driving on the left is the norm here and adapt yourself to the new rule. In this paper, we design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive reasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying terrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain principles. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings, derive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We conduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that they all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we explore \textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct agents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior performance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars.  Through Mars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set the stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in an adaptive and context-sensitive way.</p>

                        <p><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) experience "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning setups, where they tend to lose previously acquired knowledge and perform poorly on old tasks. Rehearsal-based methods, which consolidate old knowledge with a replay memory buffer, are a de facto solution due to their straightforward workflow. However, these methods often fail to adequately capture topological information, leading to incorrect input-label mappings in replay samples. To address this, we propose TACO, a topology-aware graph coarsening and continual learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced graph. Throughout each learning period, this reduced graph expands by integrating with a new graph and aligning shared nodes, followed by a "zoom-out" reduction process to maintain a stable size. We have developed a graph coarsening algorithm based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph while preserving essential topological information. We empirically demonstrate that the learning process on the reduced graph can closely approximate that on the original graph. We compare TACO with a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, proving its superiority and the necessity of preserving high-quality topological information for effective replaying.</p>

                        <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known for their effective graph encoding, are extensively used across various fields. Graph self-supervised pre-training, which trains GNN encoders without manual labels to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that have different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between contrastive Learning and PCA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and discovered that PCA's optimization objective is a special case of that in contrastive Learning. We designed an encoder with contrastive constraints to emulate PCA's generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation. In cross domain experiments, FUG has a performance close to the re-trained new models. The source code is available at: https://github.com/hedongxiao-tju/FUG.</p>

However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the $k$-WL hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has 3-WL expressive power when provided with the right tokenization. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings.</p>

In this work, we explore dynamic rescaling as a tool to influence GNN training dynamics in two key ways: i) balancing the network with respect to various criteria, and ii) controlling the relative learning speeds of different layers. We gain novel insights, unique to GNNs, that reveal distinct training modes for different tasks. For heterophilic graphs, achieving balance based on relative gradients leads to faster training and better generalization. In contrast, homophilic graphs benefit from delaying the learning of later layers. Additionally, we show that training in balance supports larger learning rates, which can improve generalization. Moreover, controlling layer-wise training speeds is linked to grokking-like phenomena, which may be of independent interest.</p>

Both types of work generally lead to large costs in training or synthesis.To reduce the cost, based on open-source available texts, we propose an efficient way that trains a small LLM for math problem synthesis, to efficiently generate sufficient high-quality pre-training data.To achieve it, we create a dataset using GPT-4 to distill its data synthesis capability into the small LLM.Concretely, we craft a set of prompts based on human education stages to guide GPT-4, to synthesize problems covering diverse math knowledge and difficulty levels.Besides, we adopt the gradient-based influence estimation method to select the most valuable math-related texts.The both are fed into GPT-4 for creating the knowledge distillation dataset to train the small LLM.We leverage it to synthesize 6 million math problems for pre-training our JiuZhang3.0 model. The whole process only needs to invoke GPT-4 API 9.3k times and use 4.6B data for training.Experimental results have shown that JiuZhang3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical reasoning datasets, under both natural language reasoning and tool manipulation settings.Our code and data will be publicly released in \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/JiuZhang3.0}.</p>

                        <p><p>Current AI alignment methodologies rely on human-provided demonstrations or judgments, and the learned capabilities of AI systems would be upper-bounded by human capabilities as a result. This raises a challenging research question: How can we keep improving the systems when their capabilities have surpassed the levels of humans? This paper answers this question in the context of tackling hard reasoning tasks (e.g., level 4-5 MATH problems) via learning from human annotations on easier tasks (e.g., level 1-3 MATH problems), which we term as easy-to-hard generalization. Our key insight is that an evaluator (reward model) trained on supervisions for easier tasks can be effectively used for scoring candidate solutions of harder tasks and hence facilitating easy-to-hard generalization over different levels of tasks. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach to scalable alignment, which firstly trains the (process-supervised) reward models on easy problems (e.g., level 1-3), and then uses them to evaluate the performance of policy models on hard problems. We show that such easy-to-hard generalization from evaluators can enable easy-to-hard generalizations in generators either through re-ranking or reinforcement learning (RL). Notably, our process-supervised 7b RL model and 34b model (reranking@1024) achieves an accuracy of 34.0% and 52.5% on MATH500, respectively, despite only using human supervision on easy problems. Our approach suggests a promising path toward AI systems that advance beyond the frontier of human supervision.</p>

However, there is an ongoing debate about the extent to which LLMs are capable ofactual reasoning. Central to this debate are two key probabilistic concepts that are essential for connecting causesto their effects: the probability of necessity (PN) and the probability of sufficiency (PS). This paper introduces a framework that is both theoretical and practical, aimed at assessing how effectively LLMs are able to replicate real-world reasoning mechanisms using these probabilistic measures. By viewing LLMs as abstract machines that process information through a natural language interface, we examine the conditions under which it is possible to compute suitable approximations of PN and PS. Our research marks an important step towards gaining a deeper understanding of when LLMs are capable of reasoning, as illustrated by a series of math examples.</p>

                        <p><p>One of the urgent tasks of artificial intelligence is to assess the safety and alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human behavior. Conventional verification only in pure natural language processing benchmarks can be insufficient. Since emotions often influence human decisions, this paper examines LLM alignment in complex strategic and ethical environments, providing an in-depth analysis of the drawbacks of our psychology and the emotional impact on decision-making in humans and LLMs. We introduce the novel EAI framework for integrating emotion modeling into LLMs to examine the emotional impact on ethics and LLM-based decision-making in various strategic games, including bargaining and repeated games. Our experimental study with various LLMs demonstrated that emotions can significantly alter the ethical decision-making landscape of LLMs, highlighting the need for robust mechanisms to ensure consistent ethical standards. Our game-theoretic analysis revealed that LLMs are susceptible to emotional biases influenced by model size, alignment strategies, and primary pretraining language. Notably, these biases often diverge from typical human emotional responses, occasionally leading to unexpected drops in cooperation rates, even under positive emotional influence. Such behavior complicates the alignment of multiagent systems, emphasizing the need for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the degree of emotional alignment. Our framework provides a foundational basis for developing such benchmarks.</p>

                        <p>One way to address safety risks from large language models (LLMs) is to censor dangerous knowledge from their training data. While this removes the explicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various training documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing together these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we study inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in which LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a suite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further experiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs $(x,f(x))$ can articulate a definition of $f$ and compute inverses.While OOCR succeeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures.Overall, the ability of LLMs to "connect the dots" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.</p>

                        <p>In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without any prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding effectively elicits reasoning capabilities from language models, which were previously obscured by standard greedy decoding.</p>

                        <p>In the era of big data, graphs have emerged as a natural representation of intricate relationships. However, graph sizes often become unwieldy, leading to storage, computation, and analysis challenges. A crucial demand arises for methods that can effectively downsize large graphs while retaining vital insights. Graph coarsening seeks to simplify large graphs while maintaining the basic statistics of the graphs, such as spectral properties and $\epsilon$-similarity in the coarsened graph. This ensures that downstream processes are more efficient and effective. Most published methods are suitable for homophilic datasets, limiting their universal use. We propose **U**niversal **G**raph **C**oarsening (UGC), a framework equally suitable for homophilic and heterophilic datasets. UGC integrates node attributes and adjacency information, leveraging the dataset's heterophily factor. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGC preserves spectral similarity while coarsening. In comparison to existing methods, UGC is 4x to 15x faster, has lower eigen-error, and yields superior performance on downstream processing tasks even at 70% coarsening ratios.</p>

                        <p><p>Graph class incremental learning (GCIL) requires the model to classify emerging nodes of new classes while remembering old classes. Existing methods are designed to preserve effective information of old models or graph data to alleviate forgetting, but there is no clear theoretical understanding of what matters in information preservation. In this paper, we consider that present practice suffers from high semantic and structural shifts assessed by two devised shift metrics. We provide insights into information preservation in GCIL and find that maintaining graph information can preserve information of old models in theory to calibrate node semantic and graph structure shifts. We correspond graph information into low-frequency local-global information and high-frequency information in spatial domain. Based on the analysis, we propose a framework, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP). Specifically, for low-frequency information preservation, the old node representations obtained by inputting replayed nodes into the old model are aligned with the outputs of the node and its neighbors in the new model, and then old and new outputs are globally matched after pooling. For high-frequency information preservation, the new node representations are encouraged to imitate the near-neighbor pair similarity of old node representations. GSIP achieves a 10\% increase in terms of the forgetting metric compared to prior methods on large-scale datasets. Our framework can also seamlessly integrate existing replay designs.

                        <p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) measures the (dis-)similarity between two given graphs in terms of the minimum-cost edit sequence, which transforms one graph to the other.GED is related to other notions of graph similarity, such as graph and subgraph isomorphism, maximum common subgraph, etc. However, the computation of exact GED is NP-Hard, which has recently motivated the design of neural models for GED estimation.However, they do not explicitly account for edit operations with different costs. In response, we propose $\texttt{GraphEdX}$, a neural GED estimator that can work with general costs specified for the four edit operations, viz., edge deletion, edge addition, node deletion, and node addition.We first present GED as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that incorporates these four costs.Then, we represent each graph as a set of node and edge embeddings and use them to design a family of neural set divergence surrogates. We replace the QAP terms corresponding to each operation with their surrogates. Computing such neural set divergence requires aligning nodes and edges of the two graphs.We learn these alignments using a Gumbel-Sinkhorn permutation generator, additionally ensuring that the node and edge alignments are consistent with each other. Moreover, these alignments are cognizant of both the presence and absence of edges between node pairs.Through extensive experiments on several datasets, along with a variety of edit cost settings, we show that $\texttt{GraphEdX}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and heuristics in terms of prediction error.

Recent advancements have utilized the diffusion model to improve gesture synthesis. However, the high computational complexity of these techniques limits the application in reality. In this study, we explore the potential of state space models (SSMs).Direct application of SSMs in gesture synthesis encounters difficulties, which stem primarily from the diverse movement dynamics of various body parts. The generated gestures may also exhibit unnatural jittering issues.To address these, we implement a two-stage modeling strategy with discrete motion priors to enhance the quality of gestures.Built upon the selective scan mechanism, we introduce MambaTalk, which integrates hybrid fusion modules, local and global scans to refine latent space representations.Subjective and objective experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models.

                        <p><p>Diverse human motion prediction (HMP) is a fundamental application in computer vision that has recently attracted considerable interest. Prior methods primarily focus on the stochastic nature of human motion, while neglecting the specific impact of external environment, leading to the pronounced artifacts in prediction when applied to real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, this work introduces a novel task: predicting diverse human motion within real-world 3D scenes. In contrast to prior works, it requires harmonizing the deterministic constraints imposed by the surrounding 3D scenes with the stochastic aspect of human motion. For this purpose, we propose DiMoP3D, a diverse motion prediction framework with 3D scene awareness, which leverages the 3D point cloud and observed sequence to generate diverse and high-fidelity predictions. DiMoP3D is able to comprehend the 3D scene, and determines the probable target objects and their desired interactive pose based on the historical motion. Then, it plans the obstacle-free trajectory towards these interested objects, and generates diverse and physically-consistent future motions. On top of that, DiMoP3D identifies deterministic factors in the scene and integrates them into the stochastic modeling, making the diverse HMP in realistic scenes become a controllable stochastic generation process. On two real-captured benchmarks, DiMoP3D has demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness in generating diverse and physically-consistent motion predictions within real-world 3D environments.</p>

                        <p><p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has unearthed the potential to assist humans in controlling advanced technologies. Shared autonomy (SA) facilitates control by combining inputs from a human pilot and an AI copilot. In prior SA studies, the copilot is constantly active in determining the action played at each time step. This limits human autonomy that may have deleterious effects on performance. In general, the amount of helpful copilot assistance varies greatly depending on the task dynamics. We therefore hypothesized that human autonomy and SA performance improves through dynamic and selective copilot intervention. To address this, we develop a goal-agnostic intervention assistance (IA) that dynamically shares control by having the copilot intervene only when the expected value of the copilot’s action exceeds that of the human’s action. We implement IA with a diffusion copilot (termed IDA) trained on expert demonstrations with goal masking. We prove that IDA performance is lower bounded by human performance, so that IDA does not negatively impact human control. In experiments with simulated human pilots, we show that IDA achieves higher performance than both pilot-only and traditional SA control in variants of the Reacher environment and Lunar Lander. We then demonstrate with human-in the-loop experiments that IDA achieves better control in Lunar Lander and that human participants experience greater autonomy and prefer IDA over pilot-only and traditional SA control. We attribute the success of IDA to preserving human autonomy while simultaneously offering assistance to prevent the human from entering universally bad states.</p>

                        <p><p>Unlike classical lexical overlap metrics such as BLEU, most current evaluation metrics for machine translation (for example, COMET or BERTScore) are based on black-box large language models. They often achieve strong correlations with human judgments, but recent research indicates that the lower-quality classical metrics remain dominant, one of the potential reasons being that their decision processes are more transparent. To foster more widespread acceptance of novel high-quality metrics, explainability thus becomes crucial. In this concept paper, we identify key properties as well as key goals of explainable machine translation metrics and provide a comprehensive synthesis of recent techniques, relating them to our established goals and properties. In this context, we also discuss the latest state-of-the-art approaches to explainable metrics based on generative models such as ChatGPT and GPT4. Finally, we contribute a vision of next-generation approaches, including natural language explanations. We hope that our work can help catalyze and guide future research on explainable evaluation metrics and, mediately, also contribute to better and more transparent machine translation systems.</p>

They assign importance scores to input features, indicating how relevant each feature is for the prediction of a deep neural network. While much research has gone into proposing new attribution methods, their proper evaluation remains a difficult challenge. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that overcomes two fundamental limitations of the widely used incremental-deletion protocol, i.e., the out-of-domain issue and lacking inter-model comparisons. This allows us to evaluate 23 attribution methods and how eight different design choices of popular vision models affect their attribution quality. We find that intrinsically explainable models outperform standard models and that raw attribution values exhibit a higher attribution quality than what is known from previous work. Further, we show consistent changes in the attribution quality when varying the network design, indicating that some standard design choices promote attribution quality.</p>

                        <p><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing, exhibiting impressive human-like capabilities. In particular, LLMs are  capable of "lying", knowingly outputting false statements. Hence, it is of interest and importance to develop methods to detect when LLMs lie. Indeed, several authors trained classifiers to detect LLM lies based on their internal model activations. However, other researchers showed that these classifiers may fail to generalise, for example to negated statements. In this work, we aim to develop a robust method to detect when an LLM is lying. To this end, we make the following key contributions: (i) We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activation vectors of true and false statements can be separated. Notably, this finding is universal and holds for various LLMs, including Gemma-7B, LLaMA2-13B, Mistral-7B and LLaMA3-8B. Our analysis explains the generalisation failures observed in previous studies and sets the stage for more robust lie detection;(ii) Building upon (i), we construct an accurate LLM lie detector. Empirically, our proposed classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 94\% accuracy in both distinguishing true from false factual statements and detecting lies generated in real-world scenarios.</p>

Through time-consuming manual interventions, a user can correct wrongly predicted concept values to enhance the model's downstream performance. We propose <em>Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models</em> (SCBMs), a novel approach that models concept dependencies. In SCBMs, a single-concept intervention affects all correlated concepts, thereby improving intervention effectiveness. Unlike previous approaches that model the concept relations via an autoregressive structure, we introduce an explicit, distributional parameterization that allows SCBMs to retain the CBMs' efficient training and inference procedure. Additionally, we leverage the parameterization to derive an effective intervention strategy based on the confidence region. We show empirically on synthetic tabular and natural image datasets that our approach improves intervention effectiveness significantly. Notably, we showcase the versatility and usability of SCBMs by examining a setting with CLIP-inferred concepts, alleviating the need for manual concept annotations.</p>

                        <p><p>The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm provides a powerful way to decompose dense layers into smaller, modular computations often more amenable to human interpretation, debugging, and editability. However, a major challenge lies in the computational cost of scaling the number of experts high enough to achieve fine-grained specialization. In this paper, we propose the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (μMoE) layer to address this, focusing on vision models. μMoE layers enable scalable expert specialization by performing an implicit computation on prohibitively large weight tensors entirely in factorized form. Consequently, μMoEs (1) avoid the restrictively high inference-time costs of dense MoEs, yet (2) do not inherit the training issues of the popular sparse MoEs' discrete (non-differentiable) expert routing. We present both qualitative and quantitative evidence that scaling μMoE layers when fine-tuning foundation models for vision tasks leads to more specialized experts at the class-level, further enabling manual bias correction in CelebA attribute classification. Finally, we show qualitative results demonstrating the expert specialism achieved when pre-training large GPT2 and MLP-Mixer models with parameter-matched μMoE blocks at every layer, maintaining comparable accuracy.

                        <p><p>The widespread use of black box prediction methods has sparked an increasing interest in algorithm/model-agnostic approaches for quantifying goodness-of-fit, with direct ties to specification testing, model selection and variable importance assessment. A commonly used framework involves defining a predictiveness criterion, applying a cross-fitting procedure to estimate the predictiveness, and utilizing the difference in estimated predictiveness between two models as the test statistic. However, even after standardization, the test statistic typically fails to converge to a non-degenerate distribution under the null hypothesis of equal goodness, leading to what is known as the degeneracy issue. To addresses this degeneracy issue, we present a simple yet effective device, Zipper. It draws inspiration from the strategy of additional splitting of testing data, but encourages an overlap between two testing data splits in predictiveness evaluation. Zipper binds together the two overlapping splits using a slider parameter that controls the proportion of overlap. Our proposed test statistic follows an asymptotically normal distribution under the null hypothesis for any fixed slider value, guaranteeing valid size control while enhancing power by effective data reuse. Finite-sample experiments demonstrate that our procedure, with a simple choice of the slider, works well across a wide range of settings.</p>

                        <p>Survival analysis is an important research topic with applications in healthcare, business, and manufacturing. One essential tool in this area is the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model, which is widely used for its interpretability, flexibility, and predictive performance. However, for modern data science challenges such as high dimensionality (both $n$ and $p$) and high feature correlations, current algorithms to train the CPH model have drawbacks, preventing us from using the CPH model at its full potential. The root cause is that the current algorithms, based on the Newton method, have trouble converging due to vanishing second order derivatives when outside the local region of the minimizer. To circumvent this problem, we propose new optimization methods by constructing and minimizing surrogate functions that exploit hidden mathematical structures of the CPH model. Our new methods are easy to implement and ensure monotonic loss decrease and global convergence. Empirically, we verify the computational efficiency of our methods. As a direct application, we show how our optimization methods can be used to solve the cardinality-constrained CPH problem, producing very sparse high-quality models that were not previously practical to construct. We list several extensions that our breakthrough enables, including optimization opportunities, theoretical questions on CPH's mathematical structure, as well as other CPH-related applications.</p>

We optimize deep hypernetworks to generate explainable linear models on a per-instance basis. As a result, our models retain the accuracy of black-box deep networks while offering free-lunch explainability for tabular data by design. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our explainable deep networks have comparable performance to state-of-the-art classifiers on tabular data and outperform current existing methods that are explainable by design.</p>

To understand this phenomenon in depth, we formulate the low-rank matrix completion problem as a masked language modeling (MLM) task, and show that it is possible to train a BERT model to solve this task to low error. Furthermore, the loss curve shows a plateau early in training followed by a sudden drop to near-optimal values, despite no changes in the training procedure or hyper-parameters. To gain interpretability insights into this sudden drop, we examine the model's predictions, attention heads, and hidden states before and after this transition. Concretely, we observe that (a) the model transitions from simply copying the masked input to accurately predicting the masked entries; (b) the attention heads transition to interpretable patterns relevant to the task; and (c) the embeddings and hidden states encode information relevant to the problem. We also analyze the training dynamics of individual model components to understand the sudden drop in loss.</p>

                        <p><p>Sparsity is a central aspect of interpretability in machine learning. Typically, sparsity is measured in terms of the size of a model globally, such as the number of variables it uses. However, this notion of sparsity is not particularly relevant for decision making; someone subjected to a decision does not care about variables that do not contribute to the decision. In this work, we dramatically expand a notion of <em>decision sparsity</em> called the <em>Sparse Explanation Value</em> (SEV) so that its explanations are more meaningful. SEV considers movement along a hypercube towards a reference point. By allowing flexibility in that reference and by considering how distances along the hypercube translate to distances in feature space, we can derive sparser and more meaningful explanations for various types of function classes. We present cluster-based SEV and its variant tree-based SEV, introduce a method that improves credibility of explanations, and propose algorithms that optimize decision sparsity in machine learning models.</p>

                        <p><p>Though vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, they exhibit surprising failures when performing tasks involving visual relations. This begs the question: how do ViTs attempt to perform tasks that require computing visual relations between objects? Prior efforts to interpret ViTs tend to focus on characterizing relevant low-level visual features. In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic interpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to perform abstract visual reasoning. We present a case study of a fundamental, yet surprisingly difficult, relational reasoning task: judging whether two visual entities are the same or different. We find that pretrained ViTs fine-tuned on this task often exhibit two qualitatively different stages of processing despite having no obvious inductive biases to do so: 1) a perceptual stage wherein local object features are extracted and stored in a disentangled representation, and 2) a relational stage wherein object representations are compared. In the second stage, we find evidence that ViTs can learn to represent somewhat abstract visual relations, a capability that has long been considered out of reach for artificial neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that failures at either stage can prevent a model from learning a generalizable solution to our fairly simple tasks. By understanding ViTs in terms of discrete processing stages, one can more precisely diagnose and rectify shortcomings of existing and future models.</p>

                        <p><p>Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately. We release our library for training e2e SAEs and reproducing our analysis athttps://github.com/ApolloResearch/e2e_sae.</p>

                        <p><p>CLIP embeddings have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of multimodal applications. However, these high-dimensional, dense vector representations are not easily interpretable,  limiting our understanding of the rich structure of CLIP and its use in downstream applications that require transparency. In this work, we show that the semantic structure of CLIP's latent space can be leveraged to provide interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of representations into semantic concepts. We formulate this problem as one of sparse recovery and propose a novel method, Sparse Linear Concept Embeddings (SpLiCE), for transforming CLIP representations into sparse linear combinations of human-interpretable concepts. Distinct from previous work, \method is task-agnostic and can be used, without training, to explain and even replace traditional dense CLIP representations, maintaining high downstream performance while significantly improving their interpretability. We also demonstrate significant use cases of \method representations including detecting spurious correlations and model editing. Code is provided at https://github.com/AI4LIFE-GROUP/SpLiCE.</p>

We propose a new method, optimal ablation (OA), and show that OA-based component importance has theoretical and empirical advantages over measuring importance via other ablation methods. We also show that OA-based component importance can benefit several downstream interpretability tasks, including circuit discovery, localization of factual recall, and latent prediction.</p>

                        <p><p>Reinforcement learning based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on human preferences has been shown to enhance both their capabilities and safety behavior.  However, in cases related to safety, without precise instructions to human annotators, the data collected may cause the model to become overly cautious, or to respond in an undesirable style, such as being judgmental.  Additionally, as model capabilities and usage patterns evolve, there may be a costly need to add or relabel data to modify safety behavior.   We propose a novel preference modeling approach that utilizes AI feedback and only requires a small amount of human data.   Our method, Rule Based Rewards (RBR), uses a collection of rules for desired or undesired behaviors (e.g. refusals should not be judgmental) along with a LLM grader.  In contrast to prior methods using AI feedback, our method uses fine-grained, composable, LLM-graded few-shot prompts as reward directly in RL training, resulting in greater control, accuracy and ease of updating.  We show that RBRs are an effective training method, achieving an F1 score of 97.1, compared to a human-feedback baseline of 91.7, resulting in much higher safety-behavior accuracy through better balancing usefulness and safety.</p>

It is based on a large language model (LLM) carefully aligned to be aware of a perception module, a motor function module, and the concept of a simple finite state machine (called neural FSM) with two states. The perception and motor function modules operate in tandem, allowing the system to speak and listen to the user simultaneously. The LLM generates textual tokens for inquiry responses and makes autonomous decisions to start responding to, wait for, or interrupt the user by emitting control tokens to the neural FSM. All these tasks of the LLM are carried out as next token prediction on a serialized view of the dialogue in real-time. In automatic quality evaluations simulating real-life interaction, the proposed system reduces the average conversation response latency by more than threefold compared with LLM-based half-duplex dialogue systems while responding within less than 500 milliseconds in more than 50% of evaluated interactions. Running an LLM with only 8 billion parameters, our system exhibits an 8% higher interruption precision rate than the best available commercial LLM for voice-based dialogue.</p>

                        <p><p>Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of existing models to be quantized, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, current quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit model compressing framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the quantization framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 81% of the non-quantized performance on LLaMA models) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.</p>

                        <p><p>Current techniques for detecting AI-generated text are largely confined to manual feature crafting and supervised binary classification paradigms. These methodologies typically lead to performance bottlenecks and unsatisfactory generalizability. Consequently, these methods are often inapplicable for out-of-distribution (OOD) data and newly emerged large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we revisit the task of AI-generated text detection. We argue that the key to accomplishing this task lies in distinguishing writing styles of different authors, rather than simply classifying the text into human-written or AI-generated text. To this end, we propose DeTeCtive, a multi-task auxiliary, multi-level contrastive learning framework. DeTeCtive is designed to facilitate the learning of distinct writing styles, combined with a dense information retrieval pipeline for AI-generated text detection. Our method is compatible with a range of text encoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the ability of various text encoders in detecting AI-generated text across multiple benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, in OOD zero-shot evaluation, our method outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Moreover, we find our method boasts a Training-Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA) capability towards OOD data, further enhancing its efficacy in OOD detection scenarios. We will open-source our code and models in hopes that our work will spark new thoughts in the field of AI-generated text detection, ensuring safe application of LLMs and enhancing compliance.</p>

                        <p><p>We study the fractal structure of language, aiming to provide a precise formalism for quantifying properties that may have been previously suspected but not  formally shown. We establish that language is: (1) self-similar, exhibiting complexities at all levels of granularity, with no particular characteristic context length, and (2) long-range dependent (LRD), with a Hurst parameter of approximately 0.7.Based on these findings, we argue that short-term patterns/dependencies in language, such as in paragraphs, mirror the patterns/dependencies over larger scopes, like entire documents. This may shed some light on how  next-token prediction can capture the structure of text across multiple levels of granularity, from words and clauses to broader contexts and intents. In addition, we carry out an extensive analysis across different domains and architectures, showing that fractal parameters are robust.Finally, we demonstrate that the tiny variations  in fractal parameters seen across LLMs improve upon perplexity-based bits-per-byte (BPB) in predicting their downstream performance. We hope these findings offer a fresh perspective on language and the mechanisms underlying the success of LLMs.</p>

                        <p><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and ever-evolving practical requirements, finding an efficient and effective alignment method has never been more critical. However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty). Specifically, Aligner-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9\% in helpfulness and 23.8\% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also effectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking Aligner-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0\% to 58.3\%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5\% Win Rate (community report).</p>

When this majority opinion is the result of a common misconception (ingrained in the models through shared training data) debate is likely to converge to answers associated with that common misconception.Using insights from our theoretical results we then propose three interventions which improve the efficacy of debate. For each intervention, we provide theoretical results demonstrating how debate is improved.We also demonstrate that these interventions result in better performance on four common benchmark tasks.</p>

In practice, we build the APC scoring system by symbolically distilling small NLI and relevance discriminators (300M parameters) from GPT-4 for efficiency, and both show high consistency with GPT-4's discrimination.We validate the quality of the APC score against human evaluation based on example personas with tens of statements, and the results show a high correlation.As the APC score could faithfully reflect the PRP quality, we further leverage it as a reward system in direct preference optimization (DPO) for better AI characters. Our experiments offer a fine-grained and explainable comparison between existing PRP techniques, revealing their advantages and limitations.We further find APC-based DPO to be one of the most competitive techniques for sticking with all constraints and can be well incorporated with other techniques.We then extend the scale of the experiments to real persons with hundreds of statements and reach a consistent conclusion. Finally, we provide comprehensive analyses and case studies to support the effectiveness of APC and APC-based DPO.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper introduces xRAG, an innovative context compression method tailored for retrieval-augmented generation. xRAG reinterprets document embeddings in dense retrieval--traditionally used solely for retrieval--as features from the retrieval modality. By employing a modality fusion methodology, xRAG seamlessly integrates these embeddings into the language model representation space, effectively eliminating the need for their textual counterparts and achieving an extreme compression rate. In xRAG, the only trainable component is the modality bridge, while both the retriever and the language model remain frozen. This design choice allows for the reuse of offline-constructed document embeddings and preserves the plug-and-play nature of retrieval augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that xRAG achieves an average improvement of over 10% across six knowledge-intensive tasks, adaptable to various language model backbones, ranging from a dense 7B model to an 8x7B Mixture of Experts configuration. xRAG not only significantly outperforms previous context compression methods but also matches the performance of uncompressed models on several datasets, while reducing overall FLOPs by a factor of 3.53. Our work pioneers new directions in retrieval-augmented generation from the perspective of multimodality fusion, and we hope it lays the foundation for future efficient and scalable retrieval-augmented systems.</p>

                        <p><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) focus on aligning to heterogeneous human expectations and values via multi-objective preference alignment. However, existing methods are dependent on the policy model parameters, which require high-cost repetition of their alignment algorithms for each new policy model, and they cannot expand to unseen objectives due to their static alignment objectives. In this work, we propose Meta-Objective Aligner (MetaAligner), the first policy-agnostic and generalizable method for multi-objective preference alignment.MetaAligner models multi-objective alignment into three stages: (1) dynamic objectives reformulation algorithm reorganizes traditional alignment datasets to supervise the model on performing flexible alignment across different objectives; (2) conditional weak-to-strong correction paradigm aligns the weak outputs of fixed policy models to approach strong outputs with higher preferences in the corresponding alignment objectives, enabling plug-and-play inferences on any policy models, which significantly reduces training costs and facilitates alignment on close-source policy models; (3) generalizable inference method flexibly adjusts target objectives by updating their text descriptions in the prompts, facilitating generalizable alignment to unseen objectives.Experimental results show that MetaAligner achieves significant and balanced improvements in multi-objective alignments on 10 state-of-the-art policy models, and saves up to 93.63% of GPU training hours compared to previous alignment methods. The model also effectively aligns unseen objectives, marking the first step towards generalizable multi-objective preference alignment.</p>

                        <p>Large language models are usually fine-tuned to align with human preferences. However, fine-tuning a large language model can be challenging. In this work, we introduce $\textit{weak-to-strong search}$, framing the alignment of a large language model as a test-time greedy search to maximize the log-probability difference between small tuned and untuned models while sampling from the frozen large model. This method serves both as (1) a compute-efficient model up-scaling strategy that avoids directly tuning the large model and as (2) an instance of weak-to-strong generalization that enhances a strong model with weak test-time guidance.Empirically, we demonstrate the flexibility of weak-to-strong search across different tasks. In controlled-sentiment generation and summarization, we use tuned and untuned $\texttt{gpt2}$s to improve the alignment of large models without additional training. Crucially, in a more difficult instruction-following benchmark, AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that reusing off-the-shelf small models (e.g., $\texttt{zephyr-7b-beta}$ and its untuned version) can improve the length-controlled win rates of both white-box and black-box large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $34.4\% \rightarrow 37.9\%$ for $\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}$ and $16.0\% \rightarrow 20.1\%$ for $\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct}$), despite the small models' low win rates $\approx 10.0\%$.</p>

                        <p><p>Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have achieved significant success on vision transformers (ViTs) adaptation by improving parameter efficiency. However, the exploration of enhancing inference efficiency during adaptation remains underexplored. This limits the broader application of pre-trained ViT models, especially when the model is computationally extensive. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Tuning (DyT), a novel approach to improve both parameter and inference efficiency for ViT adaptation. Specifically, besides using the lightweight adapter modules, we propose a token dispatcher to distinguish informative tokens from less important ones, allowing the latter to dynamically skip the original block, thereby reducing the redundant computation during inference. Additionally, we explore multiple design variants to find the best practice of DyT. Finally, inspired by the mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism, we introduce an enhanced adapter to further boost the adaptation performance. We validate DyT across various tasks, including image/video recognition and semantic segmentation. For instance, DyT achieves superior performance compared to existing PEFT methods while evoking only 71% of their FLOPs on the VTAB-1K benchmark.</p>

We aim to tackle a subclass of these ill-posed settings, characterized by a flexible separable observation probability assumption that can depend on the matrix measurements. We propose a regularized pairwise pseudo-likelihood approach for matrix completion and prove that the proposed estimator can asymptotically recover the low-rank parameter matrix up to an identifiable equivalence class of a constant shift and scaling, at a near-optimal asymptotic convergence rate of the standard well-posed (non-informative missing) setting, while effectively mitigating the impact of informative missingness. The efficacy of our method is validated via numerical experiments, positioning it as a robust tool for matrix completion to mitigate data bias.</p>

                        <p><p>Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for analyzing the topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case traditional persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the k-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Moreover, we derive a novel closed-form formula for effective resistance, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data and show that spectral distances allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.</p>

                        <p>When rows of an $n \times d$ matrix $A$ are given in a stream, we study algorithms for approximating the top eigenvector of $A^T A$ (equivalently, the top right singular vector of $A$). We consider worst case inputs $A$ but assume that the rows are presented to the streaming algorithm in a uniformly random order. We show that when the gap parameter $R = \sigma_1(A)^2/\sigma_2(A)^2 = \Omega(1)$, then there is a randomized algorithm that uses $O(h \cdot d \cdot \text{polylog}(d))$ bits of space and outputs a unit vector $v$ that has a correlation $1 - O(1/\sqrt{R})$ with the top eigenvector $v_1$. Here $h$ denotes the number of ``heavy rows'' in the matrix, defined as the rows with Euclidean norm at least $\|{A}\|_F/\sqrt{d \cdot \text{polylog}(d)}$. We also provide a lower bound showing that any algorithm using $O(hd/R)$ bits of space can obtain at most $1 - \Omega(1/R^2)$ correlation with the top eigenvector. Thus, parameterizing the space complexity in terms of the number of heavy rows is necessary for high accuracy solutions.Our results improve upon the $R = \Omega(\log n \cdot \log d)$ requirement  in a recent work of Price. We note that Price's algorithm works for arbitrary order streams whereas our algorithm requires a stronger assumption that the rows are presented in a uniformly random order. We additionally show that the gap requirements in Price's analysis can be brought down to $R = \Omega(\log^2 d)$ for arbitrary order streams and $R = \Omega(\log d)$ for random order streams. The requirement of $R = \Omega(\log d)$ for random order streams is nearly tight for Price's analysis as we obtain a simple instance with $R = \Omega(\log d/\log\log d)$ for which Price's algorithm, with any fixed learning rate, cannot output a vector approximating the top eigenvector $v_1$.</p>

                        <p><p>Modern systems for automatic speech recognition, including the RNN-Transducer and Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED), are designed so that the encoder is not required to alter the time-position of information from the audio sequence into the embedding; alignment to the final text output is processed during decoding. We discover that the transformer-based encoder adopted in recent years is actually capable of performing the alignment internally during the forward pass, prior to decoding. This new phenomenon enables a simpler and more efficient model, the ''Aligner-Encoder''. To train it, we discard the dynamic programming of RNN-T in favor of the frame-wise cross-entropy loss of AED, while the decoder employs the lighter text-only recurrence of RNN-T without learned cross-attention---it simply scans embedding frames in order from the beginning, producing one token each until predicting the end-of-message. We conduct experiments demonstrating performance remarkably close to the state of the art, including a special inference configuration enabling long-form recognition. In a representative comparison, we measure the total inference time for our model to be 2x faster than RNN-T and 16x faster than AED.  Lastly, we find that the audio-text alignment is clearly visible in the self-attention weights of a certain layer, which could be said to perform ''self-transduction''.</p>

                        <p><p>There is a rising interest and trend in research towards directly translating speech from one language to another, known as end-to-end speech-to-speech translation. However, most end-to-end models struggle to outperform cascade models, i.e., a pipeline framework by concatenating speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech models. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexities involved in direct translation tasks and the scarcity of data.  In this study, we introduce a novel model framework TransVIP that leverages diverse datasets in a cascade fashion yet facilitates end-to-end inference through joint probability. Furthermore, we propose two separated encoders to preserve the speaker’s voice characteristics and isochrony from the source speech during the translation process, making it highly suitable for scenarios such as video dubbing. Our experiments on the French-English language pair demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation model.</p>

The data is aggregated from eight public datasets, representing four perspectives: emotion, accent, age, and background sound.To assess the SD-Eval benchmark dataset, we implement three different models and construct a training set following a similar process as SD-Eval. The training set contains 1,052.72 hours of speech data and 724.4k utterances. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation using objective evaluation methods (e.g. BLEU and ROUGE), subjective evaluations and LLM-based metrics for the generated responses.Models conditioned with paralinguistic and environmental information outperform their counterparts in both objective and subjective measures.Moreover, experiments demonstrate LLM-based metrics show a higher correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics.</p>

In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is that language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead of true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of knowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of co-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer model and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple question answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower layers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these observations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual associations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit rather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual associations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the generalization of newly learned knowledge. We also propose a simple training method to actively forget the learned co-occurrence statistics, which unblocks and enhances the learning of factual associations when training on plain narrative text. On both synthetic and real-world corpora, the two proposed strategies improve the generalization of the knowledge learned during finetuning to reasoning scenarios such as indirect and multi-hop question answering.</p>

Despite recent advances, these models are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we propose a novel calibration method that can be used to combat hallucinations. We add a special [IDK] (“I Don't Know”) token to the model's vocabulary and introduce an objective function that shifts probability mass to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions. This approach allows the model to express uncertainty in its output explicitly. We evaluate our proposed method across multiple model architectures and factual downstream tasks.We find that models trained with our method are able to express uncertainty in places where they would previously make mistakes while suffering only a small loss of encoded knowledge. We further perform extensive ablation studies of multiple variations of our approach and provide a detailed analysis of the precision-recall tradeoff of our method.</p>

                        <p><p>Benefiting from the powerful language expression and planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based autonomous agents have achieved promising performance in various downstream tasks. Recently, based on the development of single-agent systems, researchers propose to construct LLM-based multi-agent systems to tackle more complicated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named COPPER, to enhance the collaborative capabilities of LLM-based agents with the self-reflection mechanism. To improve the quality of reflections, we propose to fine-tune a shared reflector, which automatically tunes the prompts of actor models using our counterfactual PPO mechanism. On the one hand, we propose counterfactual rewards to assess the contribution of a single agent’s reflection within the system, alleviating the credit assignment problem. On the other hand, we propose to train a shared reflector, which enables the reflector to generate personalized reflections according to agent roles, while reducing the computational resource requirements and improving training stability. We conduct experiments on three datasets to evaluate the performance of our model in multi-hop question answering, mathematics, and chess scenarios. Experimental results show that COPPER possesses stronger reflection capabilities and exhibits excellent generalization performance across different actor models.</p>

                        <p>Speculative decoding has demonstrated its effectiveness in accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining an identical sampling distribution. However, the conventional approach of training separate draft model to achieve a satisfactory token acceptance rate can be costly and impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel self-speculative decoding framework \emph{Kangaroo} with \emph{double} early exiting strategy, which leverages the shallow sub-network and the \texttt{LM Head} of the well-trained target LLM to construct a self-drafting model. Then, the self-verification stage only requires computing the remaining layers over the \emph{early-exited} hidden states in parallel. To bridge the representation gap between the sub-network and the full model, we train a lightweight and efficient adapter module on top of the sub-network. One significant challenge that comes with the proposed method is that the inference latency of the self-draft model may no longer be negligible compared to the big model. To boost the token acceptance rate while minimizing the latency of the self-drafting model, we introduce an additional \emph{early exiting} mechanism for both single-sequence and the tree decoding scenarios. Specifically, we dynamically halt the small model's subsequent prediction during the drafting phase once the confidence level for the current step falls below a certain threshold. This approach reduces unnecessary computations and improves overall efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our effectiveness, where Kangaroo achieves walltime speedups up to 2.04$\times$, outperforming Medusa-1 with 88.7\% fewer additional parameters.

To mitigate this limitation, we first propose a lightweight uncertainty quantification method that assesses the reliability of the proxy reward using only the last layer embeddings of the reward model. Enabled by this efficient uncertainty quantification method, we formulate AdvPO, a distributionally robust optimization procedure to tackle the reward overoptimization problem in RLHF. Through extensive experiments on the Anthropic HH and TL;DR summarization datasets, we verify the effectiveness of AdvPO in mitigating the overoptimization problem, resulting in enhanced RLHF performance as evaluated through human-assisted evaluation.</p>

The complexity is exacerbated by the presence of unlabeled data and the opaque nature of black-box anomaly detection models, which obscure the rationale behind their predictions. In this paper, we present a novel method to interpret the decision-making processes of these models, which are essential for detecting malicious activities without labeled attack data. We put forward the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree), designed to dissect and understand the structure of normal data distributions. The SCD-Tree integrates predictions from the anomaly detection model into its splitting criteria, enhancing the clustering process with the model's insights into anomalies. To further refine these segments,  the Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm is employed to define boundaries within each segmented distribution, effectively delineating normal from anomalous data points. At this point, this approach addresses the curse of dimensionality by segmenting high-dimensional data and ensures resilience to data drift and perturbations through flexible boundary fitting. We transform the intricate operations of anomaly detection into an interpretable rule's format, constructing a comprehensive set of rules for understanding.  Our method's evaluation on diverse datasets and models demonstrates superior explanation accuracy, fidelity, and robustness over existing method, proving its efficacy in environments where interpretability is paramount.</p>

                        <p><p>In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by [Bach, 2022, Information Theory with Kernel Methods]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as concentration bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.</p>

                        <p><p>A core task in multi-modal learning is to integrate information from multiple feature spaces (e.g., text and audio), offering modality-invariant essential representations of data. Recent research showed that, classical tools such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) provably identify the shared components up to minor ambiguities, when samples in each modality are generated from a linear mixture of shared and private components.  Such identifiability results were obtained under the condition that the cross-modality samples are aligned/paired according to their shared information. This work takes a step further, investigating shared component identifiability from multi-modal linear mixtures where cross-modality samples are unaligned.  A distribution divergence minimization-based loss is proposed, under which a suite of sufficient conditions ensuring identifiability of the shared components are derived. Our conditions are based on cross-modality distribution discrepancy characterization and density-preserving transform removal, which are much milder than existing studies relying on independent component analysis. More relaxed conditions are also provided via adding reasonable structural constraints, motivated by available side information in various applications. The identifiability claims are thoroughly validated using synthetic and real-world data.</p>

Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.</p>

                        <p><p>The two-stage fine-tuning (FT) method, linear probing (LP) then fine-tuning (LP-FT), outperforms linear probing and FT alone. This holds true for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One key reason for its success is the preservation of pre-trained features, achieved by obtaining a near-optimal linear head during LP. However, despite the widespread use of large language models, there has been limited exploration of more complex architectures such as Transformers. In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of LP-FT for classification tasks on the basis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into two components. This decomposition highlights the importance of the linear head norm alongside the prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a significant increase in the linear head norm during LP, which stems from training with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. This increase in the linear head norm effectively reduces changes in learned features. Furthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model calibration, which can be corrected using temperature scaling. Additionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness. Our experiments using a Transformer-based model on multiple natural language processing datasets confirm our theoretical analysis. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of LP-FT for fine-tuning language models. Code is available at https://github.com/tom4649/lp-ft_ntk.</p>

                        <p>One-shot Federated learning (FL) is a powerful technology facilitating collaborative training of machine learning models in a single round of communication. While its superiority lies in communication efficiency and privacy preservation compared to iterative FL, one-shot FL often compromises model performance. Prior research has primarily focused on employing data-free knowledge distillation to optimize data generators and ensemble models for better aggregating local knowledge into the server model. However, these methods typically struggle with data heterogeneity, where inconsistent local data distributions can cause teachers to provide misleading knowledge. Additionally, they may encounter scalability issues with complex datasets due to inherent two-step information loss: first, during local training (from data to model), and second, when transferring knowledge to the server model (from model to inversed data). In this paper, we propose FedSD2C, a novel and practical one-shot FL framework designed to address these challenges. FedSD2C introduces a distiller to synthesize informative distillates directly from local data to reduce information loss and proposes sharing synthetic distillates instead of inconsistent local models to tackle data heterogeneity. Our empirical results demonstrate that FedSD2C consistently outperforms other one-shot FL methods with more complex and real datasets, achieving up to 2.6 $\times$ the performance of the best baseline.

                        <p><p>The growing popularity of transfer learning due to the availability of models pre-trained on vast amounts of data, makes it imperative to understand when the knowledge of these pre-trained models can be transferred to obtain high-performing models on downstream target tasks. However, the exact conditions under which transfer learning succeeds in a cross-domain cross-task setting are still poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis that analyzes the transferability of the representations of pre-trained models to downstream tasks in terms of their relatedness to a given reference task. Our analysis leads to an upper bound on transferability in terms of task-relatedness, quantified using the difference between the class priors, label sets, and features of the two tasks.Our experiments using state-of-the-art pre-trained models show the effectiveness of task-relatedness in explaining transferability on various vision and language tasks. The efficient computability of task-relatedness even without labels of the target task and its high correlation with the model's accuracy after end-to-end fine-tuning on the target task makes it a useful metric for transferability estimation. Our empirical results of using task-relatedness on the problem of selecting the best pre-trained model from a model zoo for a target task highlight its utility for practical problems.</p>

By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient <em>high-rank</em> fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)---low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing.</p>

                        <p>Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be  prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models. We refer to such data  as `surrogate data'. We study a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add.</p>

                        <p><p>Anomaly detection methods typically require fully observed data for model training and inference and cannot handle incomplete data, while the missing data problem is pervasive in science and engineering, leading to challenges in many important applications such as abnormal user detection in recommendation systems and novel or anomalous cell detection in bioinformatics, where the missing rates can be higher than 30\% or even 80\%. In this work, first, we construct and evaluate a straightforward strategy, ''impute-then-detect'', via combining state-of-the-art imputation methods with unsupervised anomaly detection methods, where the training data are composed of normal samples only. We observe that such two-stage methods frequently yield imputation bias from normal data, namely, the imputation methods are inclined to make incomplete samples ''normal", where the fundamental reason is that the imputation models learned only on normal data and cannot generalize well to abnormal data in the inference stage. To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end method that integrates data imputation with anomaly detection into a unified optimization problem. The proposed model learns to generate well-designed pseudo-abnormal samples to mitigate the imputation bias and ensure the discrimination ability of both the imputation and detection processes. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of the proposed method, proving that the proposed method can correctly detect anomalies with high probability. Experimental results on datasets with manually constructed missing values and inherent missing values demonstrate that our proposed method effectively mitigates the imputation bias and surpasses the baseline methods significantly.

However, these scaling approaches are computationally expensive and overlook the significance of efficiently improving model capabilities from the vision side. Inspired by the successful applications of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in LLMs, which improves model scalability during training while keeping inference costs similar to those of smaller models, we propose CuMo, which incorporates Co-upcycled Top-K sparsely-gated Mixture-of-experts blocks into both the vision encoder and the MLP connector, thereby enhancing the multimodal LLMs with neglectable additional activated parameters during inference.CuMo first pre-trains the MLP blocks and then initializes each expert in the MoE block from the pre-trained MLP block during the visual instruction tuning stage, with auxiliary losses to ensure a balanced loading of experts.CuMo outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs across various VQA and visual-instruction-following benchmarks within each model size group, all while training exclusively on open-sourced datasets.</p>

                        <p>Multi-modal contrastive representation (MCR) of more than three modalities is critical in multi-modal learning. Although recent methods showcase impressive achievements, the high dependence on large-scale, high-quality paired data and the expensive training costs limit their further development. Inspired by recent C-MCR, this paper proposes $\textbf{Ex}$tending $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\textbf{R}$epresentation (Ex-MCR), a training-efficient and paired-data-free method to build unified contrastive representation for many modalities. Since C-MCR is designed to learn a new latent space for the two non-overlapping modalities and projects them onto this space, a significant amount of information from their original spaces is lost in the projection process. To address this issue, Ex-MCR proposes to extend one modality's space into the other's, rather than mapping both modalities onto a completely new space. This method effectively preserves semantic alignment in the original space. Experimentally, we extend pre-trained audio-text and 3D-image representations to the existing vision-text space. Without using paired data, Ex-MCR achieves comparable performance to advanced methods on a series of audio-image-text and 3D-image-text tasks and achieves superior performance when used in parallel with data-driven methods. Moreover, semantic alignment also emerges between the extended modalities (e.g., audio and 3D).</p>

                        <p>Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming. This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts. We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels. Furthermore, we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT. The dataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., _generate two concentric cylinders_) to detailed specifications (e.g., _draw two circles with center_ $(x,y)$ and _radius_ $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, \textit{and extrude along the normal by} $d$...). Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts. We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. Our proposed framework shows great potential in AI-aided design applications. Project page is available at https://sadilkhan.github.io/text2cad-project/.</p>

                        <p><p>Tasks at the intersection of vision and language have had a profound impact in advancing the capabilities of vision-language models such as dialog-based assistants. However, models trained on existing tasks are limited to turn-based interactions, where each turn must be stepped (i.e., prompted) by the user. Open-ended, asynchronous interactions where an AI model may proactively deliver timely responses or feedback based on the unfolding situation in real-time are an open challenge. In this work, we present the FIT-Coach benchmark and dataset which explores human-AI interaction in the challenging, yet controlled, real-world domain of fitness coaching -- a task which intrinsically requires monitoring live user activity and providing timely feedback. Crucially, our dataset includes corrective feedbacks to address potential user mistakes and steer them towards successful workout completion. Our experiments reveal the limitations of existing state of the art vision-language models for such asynchronous situated interactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple end-to-end streaming baseline that can respond asynchronously to user activity with appropriate feedbacks at the appropriate time.</p>

However, understanding long multimodal content, as a foundational ability for real-world applications, remains underexplored. In this work, we present Needle In A Multimodal Haystack (MM-NIAH), the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate the capability of existing MLLMs to comprehend long multimodal documents. Our benchmark includes three types of evaluation tasks: multimodal retrieval, counting, and reasoning. In each task, the model is required to answer the questions according to different key information scattered throughout the given multimodal document. Evaluating the leading MLLMs on MM-NIAH, we observe that existing models still have significant room for improvement on these tasks, especially on vision-centric evaluation. We hope this work can provide a platform for further research on long multimodal document comprehension and contribute to the advancement of MLLMs. Code and benchmark are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/MM-NIAH.</p>

                        <p><p>The era of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large web-scale datasets challenges conventional formulations of “open-world" perception. In this work, we revisit the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in the context of recent foundational VLMs. First, we point out that zero-shot VLMs such as GroundingDINO significantly outperform state-of-the-art few-shot detectors (48 vs. 33 AP) on COCO. Despite their strong zero-shot performance, such foundational models may still be sub-optimal. For example, trucks on the web may be defined differently from trucks for a target application such as autonomous vehicle perception. We argue that the task of few-shot recognition can be reformulated as aligning foundation models to target concepts using a few examples. Interestingly, such examples can be multi-modal, using both text and visual cues, mimicking instructions that are often given to human annotators when defining a target concept of interest. Concretely, we propose Foundational FSOD, a new benchmark protocol that evaluates detectors pre-trained on any external datasets and fine-tuned on multi-modal (text and visual) K-shot examples per target class. We repurpose nuImages for Foundational FSOD, benchmark several popular open-source VLMs, and provide an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2024 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 23.9 mAP!</p>

                        <p>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a preferred paradigm in many deep learning tasks, which reduces the need for human labor. Previous studies primarily focus on effectively utilising the labelled and unlabeled data to improve performance. However, we observe that how to select samples for labelling also significantly impacts performance, particularly under extremely low-budget settings. The sample selection task in SSL has been under-explored for a long time. To fill in this gap, we propose a Representative and Diverse Sample Selection approach (RDSS). By adopting a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimise a novel criterion $\alpha$-Maximum Mean Discrepancy ($\alpha$-MMD), RDSS samples a representative and diverse subset for annotation from the unlabeled data. We demonstrate that minimizing $\alpha$-MMD enhances the generalization ability of low-budget learning. Experimental results show that RDSS consistently improves the performance of several popular SSL frameworks and outperforms the state-of-the-art sample selection approaches used in Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL), even with constrained annotation budgets.</p>

While current state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets such as CIFAR provide good empirical performance, they do not have any proof of theoretical correctness. In this work, we propose a method that clusters data belonging to a union of nonlinear manifolds. Furthermore, for a given input data sample $y$ belonging to the $l$th manifold $\mathcal{M}_l$, we provide geometric conditions that guarantee a manifold-preserving representation of $y$ can be recovered from the solution to the proposed model. The geometric conditions require that (i) $\mathcal{M}_l$ is well-sampled in the neighborhood of $y$, with the sampling density given as a function of the curvature, and (ii) $\mathcal{M}_l$ is sufficiently separated from the other manifolds. In addition to providing proof of correctness in this setting, a numerical comparison with state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR datasets shows that our method performs competitively although marginally worse than methods without</p>

                        <p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental tools in machine learning with broad use as a dimensionality reduction and denoising tool. In the later setting, while PCA is known to be effective at subspace recovery and is proven to aid clustering algorithms in some specific settings, its improvement of noisy data is still not well quantified in general. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called <em>compression ratio</em> to capture the effect of PCA on high-dimensional noisy data.We show that, for data with <em>underlying community structure</em>, PCA significantly reduces the distance of data points belonging to the same community while reducing inter-community distance relatively mildly. We explain this phenomenon through both theoretical proofs and experiments on real-world data. Building on this new metric, we design a straightforward algorithm that could be used to detect outliers. Roughly speaking, we argue that  points that have a  <em>lower variance of compression ratio</em> do not share a <em>common signal</em> with others (hence could be considered outliers).We provide theoretical justification for this simple outlier detection algorithm and use simulations to demonstrate that our method is competitive with popular outlier detection tools. Finally, we run experiments on real-world high-dimension noisy data (single-cell RNA-seq) to show that removing points from these datasets via our outlier detection method improves the accuracy of clustering algorithms. Our method is very competitive with popular outlier detection tools in this task.</p>

                        <p><p>Recent work on studying memorization in self-supervised learning (SSL) suggests that even though SSL encoders are trained on millions of images, they still memorize individual data points. While effort has been put into characterizing the memorized data and linking encoder memorization to downstream utility, little is known about where the memorization happens inside SSL encoders. To close this gap, we propose two metrics for localizing memorization in SSL encoders on a per-layer (LayerMem) and per-unit basis (UnitMem). Our localization methods are independent of the downstream task, do not require any label information, and can be performed in a forward pass. By localizing memorization in various encoder architectures (convolutional and transformer-based) trained on diverse datasets with contrastive and non-contrastive SSL frameworks, we find that (1) while SSL memorization increases with layer depth, highly memorizing units are distributed across the entire encoder, (2) a significant fraction of units in SSL encoders experiences surprisingly high memorization of individual data points, which is in contrast to models trained under supervision, (3) atypical (or outlier) data points cause much higher layer and unit memorization than standard data points, and (4) in vision transformers, most memorization happens in the fully-connected layers. Finally, we show that localizing memorization in SSL has the potential to improve fine-tuning and to inform pruning strategies.</p>

                        <p><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks. However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.

                        <p><p>Efficient transfer learning has shown remarkable performance in tuning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) toward downstream tasks with limited data resources. The key challenge of efficient transfer lies in adjusting image-text alignment to be task-specific while preserving pre-trained general knowledge. However, existing methods adjust image-text alignment merely on a set of observed samples, e.g., data set and external knowledge base, which cannot guarantee to keep the correspondence of general concepts between image and text latent manifolds without being disrupted and thereby a weak generalization of the adjusted alignment. In this work, we propose a Homology Consistency (HC) constraint for efficient transfer on VLMs, which explicitly constrains the correspondence of image and text latent manifolds through structural equivalence based on persistent homology in downstream tuning. Specifically, we build simplicial complex on the top of data to mimic the topology of latent manifolds, then track the persistence of the homology classes of topological features across multiple scales, and guide the directions of persistence tracks in image and text manifolds to coincide each other, with a deviating perturbation additionally. For practical application, we tailor the implementation of our proposed HC constraint for two main paradigms of adapter tuning. Extensive experiments on few-shot learning over 11 datasets and domain generalization demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.</p>

                        <p><p>Humans can picture a sound scene given an imprecise natural language description. For example, it is easy to imagine an acoustic environment given a phrase like "the lion roar came from right behind me!". For a machine to have the same degree of comprehension,  the machine must know what a lion is (semantic attribute), what the concept of "behind" is (spatial attribute) and how these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatial attributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind). State-of-the-art audio foundation models, such as CLAP, which learn to map between audio scenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio and text pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound event localization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from a fixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position (e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g., "next to me"). To address these gaps, we present ELSA (Embeddings for Language and Spatial Audio), a spatially aware-audio and text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment  the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours and 890,038 samples of audio comprised from 8,972 simulated spatial configurations, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is a single model that is competitive with state-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization.  In particular, ELSA achieves +2.8\% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 above the LAION-CLAP baseline, and outperforms by -11.6° mean-absolute-error in 3D source localization over the SeldNET baseline on the TUT Sound Events 2018 benchmark. Moreover, we show that the representation-space of ELSA is structured, enabling swapping of direction of audio via vector arithmetic of two directional text embeddings.</p>

                        <p><p>We propose a novel approach for rendering high-quality spatial audio for 3D scenes that is in synchrony with the visual stream but does not rely or explicitly conditioned on the visual rendering. We demonstrate that such an approach enables the experience of immersive virtual tourism - performing a real-time dynamic navigation within the scene, experiencing both audio and visual content. Current audio-visual rendering approaches typically rely on visual cues, such as images, and thus visual artifacts could cause inconsistency in the audio quality. Furthermore, when such approaches are incorporated with visual rendering, audio generation at each viewpoint occurs after the rendering of the image of the viewpoint and thus could lead to audio lag that affects the integration of audio and visual streams. Our proposed approach, AV-Cloud, overcomes these challenges by learning the representation of the audio-visual scene based on a set of sparse AV anchor points, that constitute the Audio-Visual Cloud, and are derived from the camera calibration. The Audio-Visual Cloud serves as an audio-visual representation from which the generation of spatial audio for arbitrary listener location can be generated. In particular, we propose a novel module Audio-Visual Cloud Splatting which decodes AV anchor points into a spatial audio transfer function for the arbitrary viewpoint of the target listener. This function, applied through the Spatial Audio Render Head module, transforms monaural input into viewpoint-specific spatial audio. As a result, AV-Cloud efficiently renders the spatial audio aligned with any visual viewpoint and eliminates the need for pre-rendered images. We show that AV-Cloud surpasses current state-of-the-art accuracy on audio reconstruction, perceptive quality, and acoustic effects on two real-world datasets. AV-Cloud also outperforms previous methods when tested on scenes "in the wild".</p>

Subjects watched on average 2.6 Hollywood movies, for an average viewing time of 4.3 hours, and a total of 43 hours. The audio track for each movie was transcribed with manual corrections. Word onsets were manually annotated on spectrograms of the audio track for each movie. Each transcript was automatically parsed and manually corrected into the universal dependencies (UD) formalism, assigning a part of speech to every word and a dependency parse to every sentence. In total, subjects heard 36,000 sentences  (205,000 words), while they had on average 167 electrodes implanted. This is the largest dataset of intracranial recordings featuring grounded naturalistic language, one of the largest English UD treebanks in general, and one of only a few UD treebanks aligned to multimodal features. We hope that this dataset serves as a bridge between linguistic concepts, perception, and their neural representations. To that end, we present an analysis of which electrodes are sensitive to language features while also mapping out a rough time course of language processing across these electrodes.

                        <p><p>Recent advances in calcium imaging enable simultaneous recordings of up to a million neurons in behaving animals, producing datasets of unprecedented scales. Although individual neurons and their activity traces can be extracted from these videos with automated algorithms, the results often require human curation to remove false positives, a laborious process called \emph{cell sorting}. To address this challenge, we introduce ActSort, an active-learning algorithm for sorting large-scale datasets that integrates features engineered by domain experts together with data formats with minimal memory requirements. By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1–3\% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithm's widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations.  Our tests validated ActSort's performance across different experimental conditions and datasets from multiple animals.  Overall, ActSort addresses a crucial bottleneck in processing large-scale calcium videos of neural activity and thereby facilitates systems neuroscience experiments at previously inaccessible scales.

                        <p><p>Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the `"cell-type dynamical systems" (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal's choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model---which does not differentiate between cell types---did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.</p>

                        <p><p>Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide rich edge information, high dynamic range, and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (e.g., high/low speed). In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed event processing framework capable of splitting events stream adaptively. SpikeSlicer utilizes a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.</p>

                        <p><p>The brain prepares for learning even before interacting with the environment, by refining and optimizing its structures through spontaneous neural activity that resembles random noise. However, the mechanism of such a process has yet to be understood, and it is unclear whether this process can benefit the algorithm of machine learning. Here, we study this issue using a neural network with a feedback alignment algorithm, demonstrating that pretraining neural networks with random noise increases the learning efficiency as well as generalization abilities without weight transport. First, we found that random noise training modifies forward weights to match backward synaptic feedback, which is necessary for teaching errors by feedback alignment. As a result, a network with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster and reaches higher accuracy than a network without random noise training, even comparable to the backpropagation algorithm. We also found that the effective dimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise. This pre-regularization allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low rank, reducing the generalization loss during subsequent training. This also enables the network robustly to generalize a novel, out-of-distribution dataset. Lastly, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount of meta-loss, enhancing the network ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall, our results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment offers a straightforward yet effective method of pretraining that facilitates quick and reliable learning without weight transport.</p>

                        <p><p>Our visual experience in daily life are dominated by dynamic change. Decoding such dynamic information from brain activity can enhance the understanding of the brain’s visual processing system. However, previous studies predominately focus on reconstructing static visual stimuli. In this paper, we explore to decode dynamic visual perception from electroencephalography (EEG), a neuroimaging technique able to record brain activity with high temporal resolution (1000 Hz) for capturing rapid changes in brains. Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a large dataset recording signals from 20 subjects while they were watching 1400 dynamic video clips of 40 concepts. This dataset fills the gap in the lack of EEG-video pairs. Secondly, we annotate each video clips to investigate the potential for decoding some specific meta information (e.g., color, dynamic, human or not) from EEG. Thirdly, we propose a novel baseline EEG2Video for video reconstruction from EEG signals that better aligns dynamic movements with high temporal resolution brain signals by Seq2Seq architecture. EEG2Video achieves a 2-way accuracy of 79.8% in semantic classification tasks and 0.256 in structural similarity index (SSIM). Overall, our works takes an important step towards decoding dynamic visual perception from EEG signals. Our dataset and code will be released soon.</p>

                        <p><p>Success in collaborative and competitive environments, where agents must work with or against each other, requires individuals to encode the position and trajectory of themselves and others. Decades of neurophysiological experiments have shed light on how brain regions [e.g., medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus] encode the self's position and trajectory. However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.</p>

                        <p><p>Unexpected stimuli induce "error" or "surprise" signals in the brain. The theory of predictive coding promises to explain these observations in terms of Bayesian inference by suggesting that the cortex implements variational inference in a probabilistic graphical model. However, when applied to machine learning tasks, this family of algorithms has yet to perform on par with other variational approaches in high-dimensional, structured inference problems. To address this, we introduce a novel predictive coding algorithm for structured generative models, that we call divide-and-conquer predictive coding (DCPC); it differs from other formulations of predictive coding, as it respects the correlation structure of the generative model and provably performs maximum-likelihood updates of model parameters, all without sacrificing biological plausibility. Empirically, DCPC achieves better numerical performance than competing algorithms and provides accurate inference in a number of problems not previously addressed with predictive coding. We provide an open implementation of DCPC in Pyro on Github.</p>

                        <p>Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</p>

However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer’s capability—i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our scalable architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks, and scales to devices with 100+ qubits.</p>

                        <p><p>Many problems in physical sciences are characterized by the prediction of space-time sequences. Such problems range from weather prediction to the analysis of disease propagation and video prediction. Modern techniques for the solution of these problems typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time prediction mechanism. However, oftentimes, such approaches underperform in the long-range propagation of information and lack explainability. In this work, we introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of such problems. Namely, we propose to augment CNNs with advection by designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator. We show that the proposed operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with standard convolutional kernels. We then complement it with Reaction and Diffusion neural components to form a network that mimics the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, in high dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our network on a number of spatio-temporal datasets that show their merit. Our code is available at https://github.com/Siddharth-Rout/deepADRnet.</p>

                        <p><p>Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existing works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in the training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.

                        <p>Parallel-in-time (PinT) techniques have been proposed to solve systems of time-dependent differential equations by parallelizing the temporal domain. Among them, Parareal computes the solution sequentially using an inaccurate (fast) solver, and then ``corrects'' it using an accurate (slow) integrator that runs in  parallel across temporal subintervals. This work introduces RandNet-Parareal, a novel method to learn the discrepancy between the coarse and fine solutions using random neural networks (RandNets). RandNet-Parareal achieves speed gains up to x125 and x22 compared to the fine solver run serially and Parareal, respectively. Beyond theoretical guarantees of RandNets as universal approximators, these models are quick to train, allowing the PinT solution of partial differential equations on a spatial mesh of up to $10^5$ points with minimal overhead, dramatically increasing the scalability of existing PinT approaches. RandNet-Parareal's numerical performance is illustrated on systems of real-world significance, such as the viscous Burgers' equation, the Diffusion-Reaction equation, the two- and three-dimensional Brusselator, and the shallow water equation.</p>

                        <p><p>What representation do deep neural networks learn? How similar are images to each other for neural networks? Despite the overwhelming success of deep learning methods key questions about their internal workings still remain largely unanswered, due to their internal high dimensionality and complexity. To address this, one approach is to measure the similarity of activation responses to various inputs.Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs) distill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair.These matrices encapsulate the entire similarity structure of a system, indicating which input lead to similar responses.While the similarity between images is ambiguous, we argue that the spatial location of semantic objects does neither influence human perception nor deep learning classifiers. Thus this should be reflected in the definition of similarity between image responses for computer vision systems. Revisiting the established similarity calculations for RSMs we expose their sensitivity to spatial alignment. In this paper we propose to solve this through <em>semantic RSMs</em>, which are invariant to spatial permutation. We measure semantic similarity between input responses by formulating it as a set-matching problem. Further, we quantify the superiority of  <em>semantic</em> RSMs over <em>spatio-semantic</em> RSMs through image retrieval and by comparing the similarity between representations to the similarity between predicted class probabilities.</p>

                        <p><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.</p>

                        <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) data is often collected from diverse contexts involving different populations and EEG devices. This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis.

                        <p><p>Efficient coding theory posits that sensory circuits transform natural signals into neural representations that maximize information transmission subject to resource constraints. Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, shaping patterns of circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an application motivated by redundancy reduction theory, we demonstrate that when the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the circuit learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions.</p>

                        <p><p>Intrinsic dynamics within the brain can accelerate learning by providing a prior scaffolding for dynamics aligned with task objectives. Such intrinsic dynamics would ideally self-organize and self-sustain in the face of biological noise including synaptic turnover and cell death. An example of such dynamics is the formation of sequences, a ubiquitous motif in neural activity. The sequence-generating circuit in zebra finch HVC provides a reliable timing scaffold for motor output in song and demonstrates a remarkable capacity for unsupervised recovery following perturbation. Inspired by HVC, we seek a local plasticity rule capable of organizing and maintaining sequence-generating dynamics despite continual network perturbations. We adopt a meta-learning approach introduced by Confavreux et al, which parameterizes a learning rule using basis functions constructed from pre- and postsynaptic activity and synapse size, with tunable time constants. Candidate rules are simulated within initially random networks, and their fitness is evaluated according to a loss function that measures the fidelity with which the resulting dynamics encode time. We use this approach to introduce biological noise, forcing meta-learning to find robust solutions. We first show that, in the absence of perturbations, meta-learning identifies a temporally asymmetric generalization of Oja's rule that reliably organizes sparse sequential activity. When synaptic turnover is introduced, the learned rule incorporates a form of homeostasis, better maintaining robust sequential dynamics relative to other previously proposed rules. Additionally, inspired by recent findings demonstrating that the strength of projections from inhibitory interneurons in HVC also dynamically responds to perturbations, we explore the role of inhibitory plasticity in sequence-generating circuits. We find that learned plasticity adjusts both excitation and inhibition in response to manipulations, outperforming rules applied only to excitatory connections. We demonstrate how plasticity acting on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can better shape excitatory cell dynamics to scaffold timing representations.</p>

                        <p><p>A pivotal brain computation relies on the ability to sustain perception-action loops. Stochastic optimal control theory offers a mathematical framework to explain these processes at the algorithmic level through optimality principles. However, incorporating a realistic noise model of the sensorimotor system — accounting for multiplicative noise in feedback and motor output, as well as internal noise in estimation — makes the problem challenging. Currently, the algorithm that is commonly used is the one proposed in the seminal study in (Todorov, 2005). After discovering some pitfalls in the original derivation, i.e., unbiased estimation does not hold, we improve the algorithm by proposing an efficient gradient descent-based optimization that minimizes the cost-to-go while only imposing linearity of the control law. The optimal solution is obtained by iteratively propagating in closed form the sufficient statistics to compute the expected cost and then minimizing this cost with respect to the filter and control gains. We demonstrate that this approach results in a significantly lower overall cost than current state-of-the-art solutions, particularly in the presence of internal noise, though the improvement is present in other circumstances as well, with theoretical explanations for this enhanced performance. Providing the optimal control law is key for inverse control inference, especially in explaining behavioral data under rationality assumptions.</p>

                        <p><p>The vertebrate hippocampus is thought to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network’s hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and (d) slow representational drift of place fields.  We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p>

                        <p><p>Dynamic reconstruction in confocal non-line-of-sight imaging encounters great challenges since the dense raster-scanning manner limits the practical frame rate. A fewer pioneer works reconstruct high-resolution volumes from the under-scanning transient measurements but overlook temporal consistency among transient frames. To fully exploit multi-frame information, we propose the first spatial-temporal Mamba (ST-Mamba) based method tailored for dynamic reconstruction of transient videos. Our method capitalizes on neighbouring transient frames to aggregate the target 3D hidden volume. Specifically, the interleaved features extracted from the input transient frames are fed to the proposed ST-Mamba blocks, which leverage the time-resolving causality in transient measurement. The cross ST-Mamba blocks are then devised to integrate the adjacent transient features. The target high-resolution transient frame is subsequently recovered by the transient spreading module. After transient fusion and recovery, a physical-based network is employed to reconstruct the hidden volume. To tackle the substantial noise inherent in transient videos, we propose a wave-based loss function to impose constraints within the phasor field. Besides, we introduce a new dataset, comprising synthetic videos for training and real-world videos for evaluation. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of our method on both synthetic data and real world data captured by different imaging setups.

                        <p><p>3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is a key technique for analyzing turbulent flow, one of the most challenging computational problems of our century. At the core of 3D PTV is the dual-frame fluid motion estimation algorithm, which tracks particles across two consecutive frames. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy in dual-frame fluid motion estimation; however, they heavily depend on large volumes of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is <strong>completely self-supervised and notably outperforms its fully-supervised counterparts while requiring only 1\% of the training samples (without labels) used by previous methods.</strong> Our method features a novel zero-divergence loss that is specific to the domain of turbulent flow. Inspired by the success of splat operation in high-dimensional filtering and random fields, we propose a splat-based implementation for this loss which is both efficient and effective. The self-supervised nature of our method naturally supports test-time optimization, leading to the development of a tailored Dynamic Velocimetry Enhancer (DVE) module. We demonstrate that strong cross-domain robustness is achieved through test-time optimization on unseen leave-one-out synthetic domains and real physical/biological domains.

                        <p><p>Learning complex physical dynamics purely from data is challenging due to the intrinsic properties of systems to be satisfied. Incorporating physics-informed priors, such as in Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), achieves high-precision modeling for energy-conservative systems. However, real-world systems often deviate from strict energy conservation and follow different physical priors. To address this, we present a framework that achieves high-precision modeling for a wide range of dynamical systems from the numerical aspect, by enforcing Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) via a novel regularization term. It helps preserve energies for conservative systems while serving as a strong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. While TRS is a domain-specific physical prior, we present the first theoretical proof that TRS loss can universally improve modeling accuracy by minimizing higher-order Taylor terms in ODE integration, which is numerically beneficial to various systems regardless of their properties, even for irreversible systems. By integrating the TRS loss within neural ordinary differential equation models, the proposed model TREAT demonstrates superior performance on diverse physical systems. It achieves a significant 11.5% MSE improvement in a challenging chaotic triple-pendulum scenario, underscoring TREAT’s broad applicability and effectiveness.</p>

                        <p><p>Garment animation is ubiquitous in various applications, such as virtual reality, gaming, and film producing. Recently, learning-based approaches obtain compelling performance in animating diverse garments under versatile scenarios. Nevertheless, to mimic the deformations of the observed garments, data-driven methods require large scale of garment data, which are both resource-wise expensive and time-consuming. In addition, forcing models to match the dynamics of observed garment animation may hinder the potentials to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, instead of using garment-wise supervised-learning we adopt a disentangled scheme to learn how to animate observed garments: 1). learning constitutive behaviors from the observed cloth; 2). dynamically animate various garments constrained by the learned constitutive laws. Specifically, we propose Energy Unit network (EUNet) to model the constitutive relations in the format of energy. Without the priors from analytical physics models and differentiable simulation engines, EUNet is able to directly capture the constitutive behaviors from the observed piece of cloth and uniformly describes the change of energy caused by deformations, such as stretching and bending. We further apply the pre-trained EUNet to animate various garments based on energy optimizations. The disentangled scheme alleviates the need of garment data and enables us to utilize the dynamics of a piece of cloth for animating garments. Experiments show that while EUNet effectively delivers the energy gradients due to the deformations, models constrained by EUNet achieve more stable and physically plausible performance comparing with those trained in garment-wise supervised manner.</p>

                        <p><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers of unnormalized distributions over compositional objects with applications to causal discovery, NLP, and drug design. Recently, it was shown that GFlowNets can be framed as a hierarchical variational inference (HVI) method for discrete distributions. Despite this equivalence, attempts to train GFlowNets using traditional divergence measures as learning objectives were unsuccessful. Instead, current approaches for training these models rely on minimizing the log-squared difference between a proposal (forward policy) and a target (backward policy) distributions. In this work, we first formally extend the relationship between GFlowNets and HVI to distributions on arbitrary measurable topological spaces. Then, we empirically show that the ineffectiveness of divergence-based learning of GFlowNets is due to large gradient variance of the corresponding stochastic objectives. To address this issue, we devise a collection of provably variance-reducing control variates for gradient estimation based on the REINFORCE leave-one-out estimator. Our experimental results suggest that the resulting algorithms often accelerate training convergence when compared against previous approaches. All in all, our work contributes by narrowing the gap between GFlowNet training and HVI, paving the way for algorithmic advancements inspired by the divergence minimization viewpoint.</p>

Second, the discrete nature of integers renders the construction of meaningful gradients challenging, which is problematic for learning. In order to mitigate these issues, we formulate linear arithmetics over integer-valued random variables as tensor manipulations that can be implemented in a straightforward fashion using modern deep learning libraries. At the core of our formulation lies the observation that the addition of two integer-valued random variables can be performed by adapting the fast Fourier transform to probabilities in the log-domain. By relying on tensor operations we obtain a differentiable data structure, which unlocks, virtually for free, gradient-based learning. In our experimental validation we show that tensorising probabilistic integer linear arithmetics and leveraging the fast Fourier transform allows us to push the state of the art by several orders of magnitude in terms of inference and learning times.</p>

Particle smoothers offer the potential for more accurate offline data analysis by propagating information both forward and backward in time, but have classically required human-engineered dynamics and observation models.  Extending recent advances in discriminative training of particle filters, we develop a framework for low-variance propagation of gradients across long time sequences when training particle smoothers.  Our "two-filter" smoother integrates particle streams that are propagated forward and backward in time, while incorporating stratification and importance weights in the resampling step to provide low-variance gradient estimates for neural network dynamics and observation models.  The resulting mixture density particle smoother is substantially more accurate than state-of-the-art particle filters, as well as search-based baselines, for city-scale global vehicle localization from real-world videos and maps.</p>

This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.</p>

                        <p><p>Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called <em>constrained functional gradient flow</em> (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operations to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries---including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment---correspond to a combination of basic operations over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operations, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.</p>

PICs are symbolic computational graphs defining continuous LV models as hierarchies of functions that are summed and multiplied together, or integrated over some LVs. They are tractable if LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximated by tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numerical quadrature process, called QPCs.So far, only tree-shaped PICs have been explored, and training them via numerical quadrature requires memory-intensive processing at scale. In this paper, we address these issues, and present: (i) a pipeline for building DAG-shaped PICs out of arbitrary variable decompositions, (ii) a procedure for training PICs using tensorized circuit architectures, and (iii) neural functional sharing techniques to allow scalable training. In extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of functional sharing and the superiority of QPCs over traditional PCs.</p>

Our results are presented for proximal samplers that are based on Gaussian versus stable oracles. We show that proximal samplers based on the Gaussian oracle have a fundamental barrier in that they necessarily achieve only low-accuracy guarantees when sampling from a class of heavy-tailed targets. In contrast, proximal samplers based on the stable oracle exhibit high-accuracy guarantees, thereby overcoming the aforementioned limitation. We also prove lower bounds for samplers under the stable oracle and show that our upper bounds cannot be fundamentally improved.</p>

                        <p><p>Bayesian optimization is an effective technique for black-box optimization, but its applicability is typically limited to low-dimensional and small-budget problems due to the cubic complexity of computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. While various approximate GP models have been employed to scale Bayesian optimization to larger sample sizes, most suffer from overly-smooth estimation and focus primarily on problems that allow for large online samples.  In this work, we argue that Bayesian optimization algorithms with sparse GPs can more efficiently allocate their representational power to relevant regions of the search space. To achieve this, we propose focalized GP, which leverages a novel variational loss function to achieve stronger local prediction, as well as FocalBO, which hierarchically optimizes the focalized GP acquisition function over progressively smaller search spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that FocalBO can efficiently leverage large amounts of offline and online data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on robot morphology design and to control a 585-dimensional musculoskeletal system.</p>

                        <p><p>Gaussian processes are frequently deployed as part of larger machine learning and decision-making systems, for instance in geospatial modeling, Bayesian optimization, or in latent Gaussian models. Within a system, the Gaussian process model needs to perform in a stable and reliable manner to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts of the system. In this work, we study the numerical stability of scalable sparse approximations based on inducing points. To do so, we first review numerical stability, and illustrate typical situations in which Gaussian process models can be unstable. Building on stability theory originally developed in the interpolation literature, we derive sufficient and in certain cases necessary conditions on the inducing points for the computations performed to be numerically stable. For low-dimensional tasks such as geospatial modeling, we propose an automated method for computing inducing points satisfying these conditions. This is done via a modification of the cover tree data structure, which is of independent interest. We additionally propose an alternative sparse approximation for regression with a Gaussian likelihood which trades off a small amount of performance to further improve stability. We provide illustrative examples showing the relationship between stability of calculations and predictive performance of inducing point methods on spatial tasks.</p>

                        <p>Recently developed quasi-Bayesian (QB) methods \cite{fong2023martingale}  proposed a stimulating change of paradigm in Bayesian computation by directly constructing the Bayesian predictive distribution through recursion, removing the need for expensive computations involved in sampling the Bayesian posterior distribution. This has proved to be data-efficient for univariate predictions, however, existing constructions for higher dimensional densities are only possible by relying on restrictive assumptions on the model's multivariate structure. Here, we propose a wholly different approach to extend Quasi-Bayesian prediction to high dimensions through the use of Sklar's theorem, by decomposing the predictive distribution into one-dimensional predictive marginals and a high-dimensional copula. We use the efficient recursive QB construction for the one-dimensional marginals and model the dependence using highly expressive vine copulas. Further, we tune hyperparameters using robust divergences (eg. energy score) and show that our proposed Quasi-Bayesian Vine (QB-Vine) is a fully non-parametric density estimator with \emph{an analytical form} and convergence rate independent of the dimension of the data in some situations. Our experiments illustrate that the QB-Vine is appropriate for high dimensional distributions ($\sim$64), needs very few samples to train ($\sim$200) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with analytical forms for density estimation and supervised tasks by a considerable margin.</p>

                        <p><p>Bayesian coresets speed up posterior inference in the large-scale data regime by approximating the full-data log-likelihood function with a surrogate log-likelihood based on a small, weighted subset of the data. But while Bayesian coresets and methods for construction are applicable in a wide range of models, existing theoretical analysis of the posterior inferential error incurred by coreset approximations only apply in restrictive settings---i.e., exponential family models, or models with strong log-concavity and smoothness assumptions. This work presents general upper and lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of coreset approximations that reflect the full range of applicability of Bayesian coresets. The lower bounds require only mild model assumptions typical of Bayesian asymptotic analyses, while the upper bounds require the log-likelihood functions to satisfy a generalized subexponentiality criterion that is weaker than conditions used in earlier work. The lower bounds are applied to obtain fundamental limitations on the quality of coreset approximations, and to provide a theoretical explanation for the previously-observed poor empirical performance of importance sampling-based construction methods. The upper bounds are used to analyze the performance of recent subsample-optimize methods. The flexibility of the theory is demonstrated in validation experiments involving multimodal, unidentifiable, heavy-tailed Bayesian posterior distributions.</p>

To counter, we develop Sketched Lanczos Uncertainty (SLU): an architecture-agnostic uncertainty score that can be applied to pre-trained neural networks with minimal overhead. Importantly, the memory use of SLU only grows logarithmically with the number of model parameters. We combine Lanczos' algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques to compute a sketch of the leading eigenvectors of a matrix. Applying this novel algorithm to the Fisher information matrix yields a cheap and reliable uncertainty score. Empirically, SLU yields well-calibrated uncertainties, reliably detects out-of-distribution examples, and consistently outperforms existing methods in the low-memory regime.</p>

                        <p>Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have emerged as a powerful framework compactly representing probability distributions for efficient and exact probabilistic inference. It has been shown that PCs with general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure can be understood as a mixture of exponentially (in its height) many components, each of which is a product distributions over univariate marginals. However, existing structure learning algorithms for PCs often generate tree-structured circuits, or using tree-structured circuits as intermediate steps to compress them into DAG-structured circuits. This leads to an intriguing question on whether there exists an exponential gap between DAGs and trees for the PC structure.In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this conjecture by proving that, for $n$ variables, there is a quasi-polynomial upper bound $n^{O(\log n)}$ on the size of an equivalent tree computing the same probability distribution. On the other hand, we will also show that given a depth restriction on the tree, there is a super-polynomial separation between tree and DAG-structured PCs. Our work takes an important step towards understanding the expressive power of tree-structured PCs, and our techniques may be of independent interest in the study of structure learning algorithms for PCs.</p>

                        <p><p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</p>

                        <p>We develop EigenVI, an eigenvalue-based approach for black-box variational inference (BBVI). EigenVI constructs its variational approximations from orthogonal function expansions. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^D$, the lowest order term in these expansions provides a Gaussian variational approximation, while higher-order terms provide a systematic way to model non-Gaussianity. These approximations are flexible enough to model complex distributions (multimodal, asymmetric), but they are simple enough that one can calculate their low-order moments and draw samples from them. EigenVI can also model other types of random variables (e.g., nonnegative, bounded) by constructing variational approximations from different families of orthogonal functions. Within these families, EigenVI computes the variational approximation that best matches the score function of the target distribution by minimizing a stochastic estimate of the Fisher divergence. Notably, this optimization reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem, so that EigenVI effectively sidesteps the iterative gradient-based optimizations that are required for many other BBVI algorithms. (Gradient-based methods can be sensitive to learning rates, termination criteria, and other tunable hyperparameters.) We use EigenVI to approximate a variety of target distributions, including a benchmark suite of Bayesian models from posteriordb. On these distributions, we find that EigenVI is more accurate than existing methods for Gaussian BBVI.</p>

                        <p><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for behavior cloning (BC), leveraging their exceptional ability to model multi-modal distributions. Diffusion policies (DP) have elevated BC performance to new heights, demonstrating robust efficacy across diverse tasks, coupled with their inherent flexibility and ease of implementation. Despite the increasing adoption of Diffusion Policies (DP) as a foundation for policy generation, the critical issue of safety remains largely unexplored. While previous attempts have targeted deep policy networks, DP used diffusion models as the policy network, making it ineffective to be attacked using previous methods because of its chained structure and randomness injected. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive examination of DP safety concerns by introducing adversarial scenarios, encompassing offline and online attacks, global and patch-based attacks. We propose DP-Attacker, a suite of algorithms that can craft effective adversarial attacks across all aforementioned scenarios. We conduct attacks on pre-trained diffusion policies across various manipulation tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DP-Attacker has the capability to significantly decrease the success rate of DP for all scenarios. Particularly in offline scenarios, we exhibit the generation of highly transferable perturbations applicable to all frames. Furthermore, we illustrate the creation of adversarial physical patches that, when applied to the environment, effectively deceive the model.

                        <p><p>Motion forecasting for agents in autonomous driving is highly challenging due to the numerous possibilities for each agent's next action and their complex interactions in space and time. In real applications, motion forecasting takes place repeatedly and continuously as the self-driving car moves. However, existing forecasting methods typically process each driving scene within a certain range independently, totally ignoring the situational and contextual relationships between successive driving scenes. This significantly simplifies the forecasting task, making the solutions suboptimal and inefficient to use in practice. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a novel motion forecasting framework for continuous driving, named RealMotion.It comprises two integral streams both at the scene level:(1) The scene context stream progressively accumulates historical scene information until the present moment, capturing temporal interactive relationships among scene elements.(2) The agent trajectory stream optimizes current forecasting by sequentially relaying past predictions.Besides, a data reorganization strategy is introduced to narrow the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world applications, consistent with our network. These approaches enable exploiting more broadly the situational and progressive insights of dynamic motion across space and time. Extensive experiments on Argoverse series with different settings demonstrate that our RealMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, along with the advantage of efficient real-world inference.</p>

                        <p><p>Accurate motion forecasting for traffic agents is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. Mainstream methods adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-modal trajectories. While straightforward and effective, the absence of detailed representation of future trajectories may yield suboptimal outcomes, given that the agent states dynamically evolve over time. To address this problem, we introduce DeMo, a framework that decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries capturing distinct directional intentions and state queries tracking the agent's dynamic states over time. By leveraging this format, we separately optimize the multi-modality and dynamic evolutionary properties of trajectories. Subsequently, the mode and state queries are integrated to obtain a comprehensive and detailed representation of the trajectories. To achieve these operations, we additionally introduce combined Attention and Mamba techniques for global information aggregation and state sequence modeling, leveraging their respective strengths. Extensive experiments on both the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that our DeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion forecasting. In addition, we will make our code and models publicly available.</p>

                        <p><p>Generating simulations to train intelligent agents in game-playing and robotics from natural language input, user input, or task documentation remains an open-ended challenge. Existing approaches focus on parts of this challenge, such as generating reward functions or task hyperparameters. Unlike previous work, we introduce FACTORSIM that generates full simulations in code from language input that can be used to train agents. Exploiting the structural modularity specific to coded simulations, we propose to use a factored partially observable Markov decision process representation that allows us to reduce context dependence during each step of the generation. For evaluation, we introduce a generative simulation benchmark that assesses the generated simulation code’s accuracy and effectiveness in facilitating zero-shot transfers in reinforcement learning settings. We show that FACTORSIM outperforms existing methods in generating simulations regarding prompt alignment (i.e., accuracy), zero-shot transfer abilities, and human evaluation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in generating robotic tasks.</p>

                        <p>Cultural bias is pervasive in many large language models (LLMs), largely due to the deficiency of data representative of different cultures.Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media.However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale.Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection.CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures.It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs.Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs.We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education.Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on $41$ datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework.Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

To advance existing debates, we designed and executed an experiment to measure the performative power of online search providers. Instantiated in our setting, performative power quantifies the ability of a search engine to steer web traffic by rearranging results. To operationalize this definition we developed a browser extension that performs unassuming randomized experiments in the background. These randomized experiments emulate updates to the search algorithm and identify the causal effect of different content arrangements on clicks. Analyzing tens of thousands of clicks, we discuss what our robust quantitative findings say about the power of online search engines, using the Google Shopping antitrust investigation as a case study. More broadly, we envision our work to serve as a blueprint for how the recent definition of performative power can help integrate quantitative insights from online experiments with future investigations into the economic power of digital platforms.</p>

                        <p><p>Time-series anomaly detection is a fundamental task across scientific fields and industries. However, the field has long faced the ``elephant in the room:'' critical issues including flawed datasets, biased evaluation metrics, and inconsistent benchmarking practices that have remained largely ignored and unaddressed.  We introduce the TSB-AD to systematically tackle these issues in the following three aspects: (i) Dataset Integrity: with 1020 high-quality time series refined from an initial collection of 4k spanning 33 diverse domains, we provide the first large-scale, heterogeneous, meticulously curated dataset that combines the effort of human perception and model interpretation; (ii) Metric Reliability: by revealing bias in evaluation metrics, we perform ranking aggregation on a set of reliable evaluation metrics for comprehensive capturing of model performance and robustness to address concerns from the community; (iii) Comprehensive Benchmarking: with a broad spectrum of 35 detection algorithms, from statistical methods to the latest foundation models, we perform systematic hyperparameter tuning for a fair and complete comparison. Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom regarding the superiority of advanced neural network architectures, revealing that simpler architectures and statistical methods often yield better performance. While foundation models demonstrate promise, we need to proceed with caution in terms of data contamination. We open-source the dataset and implementation at https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-AD to promote further research.</p>

                        <p><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains.      While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series.     This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset.     To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability.      Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first multimodal time series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses.      Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15\% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40\% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA.

                        <p><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being applied to time series forecasting. But are language models actually useful for time series? In a series of ablation studies on three recent and popular LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we find that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer does not degrade forecasting performance---in most cases, the results even improve! We also find that despite their significant computational cost, pretrained LLMs do no better than models trained from scratch, do not represent the sequential dependencies in time series, and do not assist in few-shot settings. Additionally, we explore time series encoders and find that patching and attention structures perform similarly to LLM-based forecasters.

                        <p><p>Performative prediction aims to model scenarios where predictive outcomes subsequently influence the very systems they target. The pursuit of a performative optimum (PO)—minimizing performative risk—is generally reliant on modeling of the distribution map, which characterizes how a deployed ML model alters the data distribution. Unfortunately, inevitable misspecification of the distribution map can lead to a poor approximation of the true PO. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework of distributionally robust performative prediction and study a new solution concept termed as distributionally robust performative optimum (DRPO). We show provable guarantees for DRPO as a robust approximation to the true PO when the nominal distribution map is different from the actual one. Moreover, distributionally robust performative prediction can be reformulated as an augmented performative prediction problem, enabling efficient optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that DRPO offers potential advantages over traditional PO approach when the distribution map is misspecified at either micro- or macro-level.</p>

                        <p><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of controllable image generation, while also coming along with issues of privacy leakage and data copyrights. Membership inference arises in these contexts as a potential auditing method for detecting unauthorized data usage. While some efforts have been made on diffusion models, they are not applicable to text-to-image diffusion models due to the high computation overhead and enhanced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first identify a conditional overfitting phenomenon in text-to-image diffusion models, indicating that these models tend to overfit the conditional distribution of images given the corresponding text rather than the marginal distribution of images only. Based on this observation, we derive an analytical indicator, namely Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy (CLiD), to perform membership inference, which reduces the stochasticity in estimating memorization of individual samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across various data distributions and dataset scales. Additionally, our method shows superior resistance to overfitting mitigation strategies, such as early stopping and data augmentation.</p>

                        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically harmless but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted prompts known as ``jailbreaks'', which can bypass protective measures and induce harmful behavior. Recent advancements in LLMs have incorporated moderation guardrails that can filter outputs, which trigger processing errors for certain malicious questions. Existing red-teaming benchmarks often neglect to include questions that trigger moderation guardrails, making it difficult to evaluate jailbreak effectiveness. To address this issue, we introduce JAMBench, a harmful behavior benchmark designed to trigger and evaluate moderation guardrails. JAMBench involves 160 manually crafted instructions covering four major risk categories at multiple severity levels. Furthermore, we propose a jailbreak method, JAM (Jailbreak Against Moderation), designed to attack moderation guardrails using jailbreak prefixes to bypass input-level filters and a fine-tuned shadow model functionally equivalent to the guardrail model to generate cipher characters to bypass output-level filters. Our extensive experiments on four LLMs demonstrate that JAM achieves higher jailbreak success ($\sim$ $\times$ 19.88) and lower filtered-out rates ($\sim$ $\times$ 1/6) than baselines.</p>

                        <p><p>Performative learning addresses the increasingly pervasive situations in which algorithmic decisions may induce changes in the data distribution as a consequence of their public deployment.  We propose a novel view in which these performative effects are modelled as push forward measures. This general framework encompasses existing models and enables novel performative gradient estimation methods, leading to more efficient and scalable learning strategies. For distribution shifts, unlike previous models which require full specification of the data distribution, we only assume knowledge of the shift operator that represents the performative changes. This approach can also be integrated into various change-of-variable-based models, such as VAEs or normalizing flows. Focusing on classification with a linear-in-parameters performative effect, we prove the convexity of the performative risk under a new set of assumptions. Notably, we do not limit the strength of performative effects but rather their direction, requiring only that classification becomes harder when deploying more accurate models. In this case, we also establish a connection with adversarially robust classification by reformulating the performative risk as a min-max variational problem. Finally, we illustrate our approach on synthetic and real datasets.</p>

To uncover potential security risks, attacking the safety-critical task of person detection has garnered significant attention. However, we observe that existing attack methods overlook the pivotal role of the camera, involving capturing real-world scenes and converting them into digital images, in the physical adversarial attack workflow. This oversight leads to instability and challenges in reproducing these attacks. In this work, we revisit patch-based attacks against person detectors and introduce a camera-agnostic physical adversarial attack to mitigate this limitation. Specifically, we construct a differentiable camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) proxy network to compensate for the physical-to-digital transition gap. Furthermore, the camera ISP proxy network serves as a defense module, forming an adversarial optimization framework with the attack module. The attack module optimizes adversarial patches to maximize effectiveness, while the defense module optimizes the conditional parameters of the camera ISP proxy network to minimize attack effectiveness. These modules engage in an adversarial game, enhancing cross-camera stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Camera-Agnostic Patch (CAP) attack effectively conceals persons from detectors across various imaging hardware, including two distinct cameras and four smartphones.</p>

However, these models often exhibit biases that can skew outputs towards societal stereotypes, thus necessitating debiasing strategies. Existing debiasing methods focus narrowly on specific modalities or tasks, and require extensive retraining. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance. This approach not only enhances the fairness of VLMs applications but also preserves their efficiency and utility across diverse scenarios.</p>

                        <p><p>With increasing privacy concerns in artificial intelligence, regulations have mandated the right to be forgotten, granting individuals the right to withdraw their data from models. Machine unlearning has emerged as a potential solution to enable selective forgetting in models, particularly in recommender systems where historical data contains sensitive user information. Despite recent advances in recommendation unlearning, evaluating unlearning methods comprehensively remains challenging due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework and overlooked aspects of deeper influence, e.g., fairness. To address these gaps, we propose CURE4Rec, the first comprehensive benchmark for recommendation unlearning evaluation. CURE4Rec covers four aspects, i.e., unlearning Completeness, recommendation Utility, unleaRning efficiency, and recommendation fairnEss, under three data selection strategies, i.e., core data, edge data, and random data. Specifically, we consider the deeper influence of unlearning on recommendation fairness and robustness towards data with varying impact levels. We construct multiple datasets with CURE4Rec evaluation and conduct extensive experiments on existing recommendation unlearning methods.

                        <p><p>The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset using LLMs and jailbreaking prompt attacks. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</p>

                        <p>Given the ubiquitous presence of time series data across various domains, precise forecasting of time series holds significant importance and finds widespread real-world applications such as energy, weather, healthcare, etc. While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals fordependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, Attraos, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as low-dimensional observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding along with a novel multi-resolution dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamical structures, and evolves by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</p>

In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of explicitly modeling this periodicity to enhance the performance of models in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) technique, which utilizes learnable recurrent cycles to model the inherent periodic patterns within sequences, and then performs predictions on the residual components of the modeled cycles. Combining RCF with a Linear layer or a shallow MLP forms the simple yet powerful method proposed in this paper, called CycleNet. CycleNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in multiple domains including electricity, weather, and energy, while offering significant efficiency advantages by reducing over 90% of the required parameter quantity. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play technique, the RCF can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy of existing models, including PatchTST and iTransformer.

                        <p><p>Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Among its variants, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is particularly relevant in real-world, cross-organizational collaborations, where distinct features of a shared instance group are contributed by different parties. In these scenarios, parties are often linked using fuzzy identifiers, leading to a common practice termed as <em>multi-party fuzzy VFL</em>. Existing models generally address either multi-party VFL or fuzzy VFL between two parties. Extending these models to practical multi-party fuzzy VFL typically results in significant performance degradation and increased costs for maintaining privacy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the <em>Federated Transformer (FeT)</em>, a novel framework that supports multi-party VFL with fuzzy identifiers. FeT innovatively encodes these identifiers into data representations and employs a transformer architecture distributed across different parties, incorporating three new techniques to enhance performance. Furthermore, we have developed a multi-party privacy framework for VFL that integrates differential privacy with secure multi-party computation, effectively protecting local representations while minimizing associated utility costs. Our experiments demonstrate that the FeT surpasses the baseline models by up to 46\% in terms of accuracy when scaled to 50 parties. Additionally, in two-party fuzzy VFL settings, FeT also shows improved performance and privacy over cutting-edge VFL models.</p>

                        <p><p>AI systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that interrupts the models as they respond with harmful outputs with "circuit breakers." Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training, circuit-breaking directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, circuit breakers allow the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks.</p>

                        <p><p>Alignment techniques are critical in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) output helpful and harmless content by enforcing the LLM-generated content to align with human preferences. However, the existence of noisy preferences (NPs), where the responses are mistakenly labelled as chosen or rejected, could spoil the alignment, thus making the LLMs generate useless and even malicious content. Existing methods mitigate the issue of NPs from the loss perspective by adjusting the alignment loss based on a clean validation dataset.Orthogonal to these loss-oriented methods, we propose perplexity-aware correction (PerpCorrect) from the data perspective for robust alignment which detects and corrects NPs based on the differences between the perplexity of the chosen and rejected responses (dubbed as PPLDiff). Intuitively, a higher PPLDiff indicates a higher probability of the NP because a rejected/chosen response which is mistakenly labelled as chosen/rejected is less preferable to be generated by an aligned LLM, thus having a higher/lower perplexity.PerpCorrect works in three steps: (1) PerpCorrect aligns a surrogate LLM using the clean validation data to make the PPLDiff able to distinguish clean preferences (CPs) and NPs. (2) PerpCorrect further aligns the surrogate LLM by incorporating the reliable clean training data whose PPLDiff is extremely small and reliable noisy training data whose PPLDiff is extremely large after correction to boost the discriminatory power.(3) Detecting and correcting NPs according to the PPLDiff obtained by the aligned surrogate LLM to obtain a denoised training dataset for robust alignment.Comprehensive experiments validate that our proposed PerpCorrect can achieve state-of-the-art alignment performance under NPs.Notably, PerpCorrect demonstrates practical utility by requiring only a modest amount of validation data and being compatible with various alignment techniques.

                        <p><p>Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with safety alignment can be jail-broken by fine-tuning on a dataset mixed with harmful data. For the first time in the literature, we show that the jail-break effect can be mitigated by separating two states in the fine-tuning stage to respectively optimize over the alignment and user datasets. Unfortunately, our subsequent study shows that this simple Bi-State Optimization (BSO) solution experiences convergence instability when steps invested in its alignment state is too small, leading to downgraded alignment performance. By statistical analysis, we show that the \textit{excess drift} towards the switching iterates of the two states could be a probable reason for the instability. To remedy this issue, we propose \textbf{L}azy(\textbf{i}) \textbf{s}afety \textbf{a}lignment (\textbf{Lisa}), which introduces a proximal term to constraint the drift of each state. Theoretically, the benefit of the proximal term is supported by the convergence analysis, wherein we show that a sufficient large proximal factor is necessary to guarantee Lisa's convergence.   Empirically, our results on four downstream fine-tuning tasks show that Lisa with a proximal term can significantly increase alignment performance while maintaining the LLM's accuracy on the user tasks.

                        <p><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial but challenging task in many high-dimensional learning problems to increase the confidence of a given predictor. We develop a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression that applies both to classical optimization approaches such as the LASSO as well as to neural networks. One of the most notable UQ techniques is the debiased LASSO, which modifies the LASSO to allow for the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals by decomposing the estimation error into a Gaussian and an asymptotically vanishing bias component. However, in real-world problems with finite-dimensional data, the bias term is often too significant to disregard, resulting in overly narrow confidence intervals. Our work rigorously addresses this issue and derives a data-driven adjustment that corrects the confidence intervals for a large class of predictors by estimating the means and variances of the bias terms from training data, exploiting high-dimensional concentration phenomena. This gives rise to non-asymptotic confidence intervals, which can help avoid overestimating certainty in critical applications such as MRI diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis extends beyond sparse regression to data-driven predictors like neural networks, enhancing the reliability of model-based deep learning. Our findings bridge the gap between established theory and the practical applicability of such methods.</p>

To mitigate this issue, researchers proposed unlearning techniques that attempt to induce the model to unlearn potentially harmful prompts. However, these methods are easily bypassed by adversarial attacks, making them unreliable for ensuring the safety of generated images. In this paper, we propose Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO), a novel framework for removing NSFW content from T2I models while preserving their performance on unrelated topics. DUO employs a preference optimization approach using curated paired image data, ensuring that the model learns to remove unsafe visual concepts while retain unrelated features. Furthermore, we introduce an output-preserving regularization term to maintain the model's generative capabilities on safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUO can robustly defend against various state-of-the-art red teaming methods without significant performance degradation on unrelated topics, as measured by FID and CLIP scores. Our work contributes to the development of safer and more reliable T2I models, paving the way for their responsible deployment in both closed-source and open-source scenarios.</p>

                        <p>LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning, utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to interact with environments. Current agents typically utilize a memory module or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning and execution. However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. To uncover such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their long-term memory orRAG knowledge base. In particular, we form the trigger generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge base with high probability. In the meantime, benign instructions without the trigger will still maintain normal performance. Unlike conventional backdoor attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, resilience, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's effectiveness in attackingthree types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare EHRAgent. We inject the poisoning instances into the RAG knowledge base and long-term memories of these agents, respectively, demonstrating the generalization of AgentPoison. On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate of $\ge$ 80% with minimalimpact on benign performance ($\le$ 1%) with a poison rate < 0.1%.

                        <p><p>In this paper, we explore the properties of loss curvature with respect to input data in deep neural networks. Curvature of loss with respect to input (termed input loss curvature) is the trace of the Hessian of the loss with respect to the input. We investigate how input loss curvature varies between train and test sets, and its implications for train-test distinguishability. We develop a theoretical framework that derives an upper bound on the train-test distinguishability based on privacy and the size of the training set. This novel insight fuels the development of a new black box membership inference attack utilizing input loss curvature. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments in computer vision classification tasks, demonstrating that input loss curvature surpasses existing methods in membership inference effectiveness. Our analysis highlights how the performance of membership inference attack (MIA) methods varies with the size of the training set, showing that curvature-based MIA outperforms other methods on sufficiently large datasets. This condition is often met by real datasets, as demonstrated by our results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. These findings not only advance our understanding of deep neural network behavior but also improve the ability to test privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning.</p>

                        <p>Real-world machine learning systems often encounter model performance degradation due to distributional shifts in the underlying data generating process (DGP). Existing approaches to addressing shifts, such as concept drift adaptation, are limited by their *reason-agnostic* nature. By choosing from a pre-defined set of actions, such methods implicitly assume that the causes of model degradation are irrelevant to what actions should be taken, limiting their ability to select appropriate adaptations. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm to overcome these limitations, called *self-healing machine learning* (SHML). Contrary to previous approaches, SHML autonomously diagnoses the reason for degradation and proposes diagnosis-based corrective actions. We formalize SHML as an optimization problem over a space of adaptation actions to minimize the expected risk under the shifted DGP.  We introduce a theoretical framework for self-healing systems and build an agentic self-healing solution *$\mathcal{H}$-LLM* which uses large language models to perform self-diagnosis by reasoning about the structure underlying the DGP, and self-adaptation by proposing and evaluating corrective actions. Empirically, we analyze different components of *$\mathcal{H}$-LLM* to understand *why* and *when* it works, demonstrating the potential of self-healing ML.</p>

                        <p><p>Toxicity classification in textual content remains a significant problem. Data with labels from a single annotator fall short of capturing the diversity of human perspectives. Therefore, there is a growing need to incorporate crowdsourced annotations for training an effective toxicity classifier. Additionally, the standard approach to training a classifier using empirical risk minimization (ERM) may fail to address the potential shifts between the training set and testing set due to exploiting spurious correlations. This work introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework that integrates crowdsourced annotations with the soft-labeling technique and optimizes the soft-label weights by Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) to enhance the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) risk. We theoretically prove the convergence of our bi-level optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in leveraging crowdsourced annotations to achieve more effective and robust toxicity classification.</p>

Our approach builds on conformal prediction, a powerful framework to construct prediction sets that are valid under the i.i.d assumption. Importantly, naively applying conformal prediction does not provide reliable predictions in this setting, due to the distribution shift induced by the corruptions. To account for the distribution shift, we assume access to privileged information (PI). The PI is formulated as additional features that explain the distribution shift, however, they are only available during training and absent at test time.We approach this problem by introducing a novel generalization of weighted conformal prediction and support our method with theoretical coverage guarantees. Empirical experiments on both real and synthetic datasets indicate that our approach achieves a valid coverage rate and constructs more informative predictions compared to existing methods, which are not supported by theoretical guarantees.</p>

WildTeaming reveals previously unidentified vulnerabilities of frontier LLMs, resulting in more diverse and successful adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art jailbreaking methods. While there exist many datasets for jailbreak evaluation, very few open-source datasets exist for jailbreak training, as safety training data has been closed among all frontier models even when their weights are open. Therefore, with WildTeaming we create WildJailbreak, a large-scale open-source synthetic safety dataset with 262K vanilla (direct request) and adversarial (complex jailbreak) prompt-response pairs. In order to mitigate exaggerated safety behaviors, WildJailbreak provides two contrastive types of queries: 1) harmful queries (both vanilla and adversarial) and 2) benign queries that resemble harmful queries in form but contain no harmful intent. As WildJailbreak considerably upgrades the quality and scale of existing safety resources, it uniquely enables us to examine the scaling effects of data and the interplay of data properties and model capabilities during safety training. Through extensive model training and evaluations, we identify the training properties that enable an ideal balance of safety behaviors: appropriate safeguarding without over-refusal, effective handling of both vanilla and adversarial queries, and minimal, if any, decrease in general capabilities. All the components of WildJailbreak contribute to achieving balanced safety behaviors of models</p>

                        <p><p>The recent emergence of powerful Vision-Language models (VLMs) has significantly improved image captioning. Some of these models are extended to caption videos as well. However, their capabilities to understand complex scenes are limited, and the descriptions they provide for scenes tend to be overly verbose and focused on the superficial appearance of objects. Scene descriptions, especially in movies, require a deeper contextual understanding, unlike general-purpose video captioning. To address this challenge, we propose a model, CALVIN, a specialized video LLM that leverages previous movie context to generate fully "contextual" scene descriptions. To achieve this, we train our model on a suite of tasks that integrate both image-based question-answering and video captioning within a unified framework, before applying instruction tuning to refine the model's ability to provide scene captions. Lastly, we observe that our model responds well to prompt engineering and few-shot in-context learning techniques, enabling the user to adapt it to any new movie with very little additional annotation.</p>

                        <p><p>The Janus Problem is a common issue in SDS-based text-to-3D methods. Due to view encoding approach and 2D diffusion prior guidance, the 3D representation model tends to learn content with higher certainty from each perspective, leading to view inconsistency. In this work, we first model and analyze the problem, visualizing the specific causes of the Janus Problem, which are associated with discrete view encoding and shared priors in 2D lifting. Based on this, we further propose the LCGen method, which guides text-to-3D to obtain different priors with different certainty from various viewpoints, aiding in view-consistent generation. Experiments have proven that our LCGen method can be directly applied to different SDS-based text-to-3D methods, alleviating the Janus Problem without introducing additional information, increasing excessive training burden, or compromising the generation effect.</p>

                        <p>We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise. Without computational considerations, the sample complexity of this learning problem is known to be $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon))$. Prior computationally efficient algorithms for the problem incur sample complexity $\tilde{O}(1/(\gamma^4 \epsilon^3))$ and achieve 0-1 error of $\eta+\epsilon$, where $\eta<1/2$ is the upper bound on the noise rate.Recent work gave evidence of an information-computation tradeoff, suggesting that a quadratic dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is required for computationally efficient algorithms. Our main result is a computationally efficient learner with sample complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon^2))$, nearly matching this lower bound. In addition, our algorithm is simple and practical, relying on online SGD on a carefully selected sequence of convex losses.</p>

                        <p>Generative retrieval represents a novel approach to information retrieval, utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture to directly produce relevant document identifiers (docids) for queries. While this method offers benefits, current implementations are limited to scenarios with binary relevance data, overlooking the potential for documents to have multi-graded relevance. Extending generative retrieval to accommodate multi-graded relevance poses challenges, including the need to reconcile likelihood probabilities for docid pairs and the possibility of multiple relevant documents sharing the same identifier. To address these challenges, we introduce a new framework called GRaded Generative Retrieval (GR$^2$). Our approach focuses on two key components: ensuring relevant and distinct identifiers, and implementing multi-graded constrained contrastive training. Firstly, we aim to create identifiers that are both semantically relevant and sufficiently distinct to represent individual documents effectively. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the relevance and distinctness of docids through a combination of docid generation and autoencoder models. Secondly, we incorporate information about the relationship between relevance grades to guide the training process. Specifically, we leverage a constrained contrastive training strategy to bring the representations of queries and the identifiers of their relevant documents closer together, based on their respective relevance grades.Extensive experiments on datasets with both multi-graded and binary relevance demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

Our main positive result is a new algorithm for reliable learning of Gaussian halfspaces on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with sample and computational complexity $d^{O(\log (\min\{1/\alpha, 1/\epsilon\}))}\min (2^{\log(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log (1/\alpha))}},2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)})$, where $\epsilon$ is the excess error and $\alpha$ is the bias of the optimal halfspace. We complement our upper bound with a Statistical Query lower bound suggesting that the $d^{\Omega(\log (1/\alpha))}$ dependence is best possible.

Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors.Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</p>

                        <p><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation, leading to their deployment across various domains. Among these, the medical field is particularly well-suited for LLM applications, as many medical tasks can be enhanced by these models. Despite the existence of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in medical question-answering and exams, there remains a notable gap in assessing LLMs' performance in supporting patients throughout their entire hospital visit journey in real-world clinical practice. In this paper, we address this gap by dividing a typical patient's hospital visit journey into four stages: planning, access, delivery and ongoing care. For each stage, we introduce multiple tasks and provide corresponding datasets. In total, the proposed benchmark comprises 12 datasets, of which five are newly introduced, and seven are constructed from existing datasets. This proposed benchmark allows us to cover the entire patient journey, thereby offering a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' effectiveness in real-world clinical settings. In addition to introducing this benchmark, we also evaluate three categories of LLMs against it: 1) proprietary LLM services such as GPT-4; 2) public LLMs like QWen; and 3) specialized medical LLMs, like HuatuoGPT2. Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide a more understanding of LLMs' performance in the medical domain, ultimately contributing to their more effective deployment in healthcare settings.</p>

                        <p>Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is crucial for identifying newtherapeutics and detecting mechanisms of action. While structure-based methodsaccurately model physical interactions between a drug and its protein target,cell-based assays such as Cell Painting can better capture complex DTIinteractions. This paper introduces MOTI$\mathcal{V}\mathcal{E}$, a MorphologicalcOmpound Target Interaction Graph datasetthat comprises Cell Painting features for $11,000$ genes and $3,600$ compoundsalong with their relationships extracted from seven publicly availabledatabases. We provide random, cold-source (new drugs), and cold-target (newgenes) data splits to enable rigorous evaluation under realistic use cases. Ourbenchmark results show that graph neural networks that use Cell Paintingfeatures consistently outperform those that learn from graph structure alone,feature-based models, and topological heuristics. MOTI$\mathcal{V}\mathcal{E}$accelerates both graph ML research and drug discovery by promoting thedevelopment of more reliable DTI prediction models.

                        <p><p>Models for student reading performance can empower educators and institutions to proactively identify at-risk students, thereby enabling early and tailored instructional interventions. However, there are no suitable publicly available educational datasets for modeling and predicting future reading performance. In this work, we introduce the Enhanced Core Reading Instruction (ECRI) dataset, a novel large-scale longitudinal tabular dataset collected across 44 schools with 6,916 students and 172 teachers. We leverage the dataset to empirically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art machine learning models to recognize early childhood educational patterns in multivariate and partial measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate a simple self-supervised strategy in which a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) network is pre-trained over masked inputs to outperform several strong baselines while generalizing over diverse educational settings. To facilitate future developments in precise modeling and responsible use of models for individualized and early intervention strategies, we will make our data and code publicly available.</p>

                        <p><p>Generating synthetic fake faces, known as pseudo-fake faces, is an effective way to improve the generalization of DeepFake detection. Existing methods typically generate these faces by blending real or fake faces in spatial domain. While these methods have shown promise, they overlook the simulation of frequency distribution in pseudo-fake faces, limiting the learning of generic forgery traces in-depth. To address this, this paper introduces {\em FreqBlender}, a new method that can generate pseudo-fake faces by blending frequency knowledge. Concretely, we investigate the major frequency components and propose a Frequency Parsing Network to adaptively partition frequency components related to forgery traces. Then we blend this frequency knowledge from fake faces into real faces to generate pseudo-fake faces. Since there is no ground truth for frequency components, we describe a dedicated training strategy by leveraging the inner correlations among different frequency knowledge to instruct the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing DeepFake detection, making it a potential plug-and-play strategy for other methods.</p>

                        <p><p>In this paper we present a novel method for efficient and effective 3D surface reconstruction in open scenes. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based works typically require extensive training and rendering time due to the adopted implicit representations. In contrast, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) uses an explicit and discrete representation, hence the reconstructed surface is built by the huge number of Gaussian primitives, which leads to excessive memory consumption and rough surface details in sparse Gaussian areas.To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Voxel Kernel Functions (GVKF), which establish a continuous scene representation based on discrete 3DGS through kernel regression. The GVKF integrates fast 3DGS rasterization and highly effective scene implicit representations, achieving high-fidelity open scene surface reconstruction. Experiments on challenging scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GVKF, featuring with high reconstruction quality, real-time rendering speed, significant savings in storage and training memory consumption.</p>

                        <p><p>The ability to promptly respond to environmental changes is crucial for the perception system of autonomous driving. Recently, a new task called streaming perception was proposed. It jointly evaluate the latency and accuracy into a single metric for video online perception. In this work, we introduce StreamDSGN, the first real-time stereo-based 3D object detection framework designed for streaming perception. StreamDSGN is an end-to-end framework that directly predicts the 3D properties of objects in the next moment by leveraging historical information, thereby alleviating the accuracy degradation of streaming perception. Further, StreamDSGN applies three strategies to enhance the perception accuracy: (1) A feature-flow-based fusion method, which generates a pseudo-next feature at the current moment to address the misalignment issue between feature and ground truth. (2) An extra regression loss for explicit supervision of object motion consistency in consecutive frames. (3) A large kernel backbone with a large receptive field for effectively capturing long-range spatial contextual features caused by changes in object positions. Experiments on the KITTI Tracking dataset show that, compared with the strong baseline, StreamDSGN significantly improves the streaming average precision by up to 4.33%.

                        <p><p>Collaborative learning offers a promising avenue for leveraging decentralized data. However, collaboration in groups of strategic learners is not a given. In this work, we consider strategic agents who wish to train a model together but have sampling distributions of different quality. The collaboration is organized by a benevolent aggregator who gathers samples so as to maximize total welfare, but is unaware of data quality. This setting allows us to shed light on the deleterious effect of adverse selection in collaborative learning. More precisely, we demonstrate that when data quality indices are private, the coalition may undergo a phenomenon known as unravelling, wherein it shrinks up to the point that it becomes empty or solely comprised of the worst agent. We show how this issue can be addressed without making use of external transfers, by proposing a novel method inspired by probabilistic verification. This approach makes the grand coalition a Nash equilibrium with high probability  despite information asymmetry, thereby breaking unravelling.</p>

                        <p><p>Large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, producing objects not present in the given images. While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously.We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1) LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2) The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations.(3) Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors.We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues.</p>

In this setting, at each time point, the adversary draws an example from a distribution that has a bounded density with respect to a fixed base measure, which is known apriori to the learner. For binary classification and scalar-valued regression, previous works [Haghtalab et al., 2020, Block et al., 2022] have shown that smoothed online learning is as easy as learning in the iid batch setting under PAC model. However, we show that smoothed online classification can be harder than the iid batch classification when the label space is unbounded. In particular, we construct a hypothesis class that is learnable in the iid batch setting under the PAC model but is not learnable under the smoothed online model. Finally, we identify a condition that ensures that the PAC learnability of a hypothesis class is sufficient for its smoothed online learnability.</p>

Prior work towards this objective has been largely restricted to perturbation-based data augmentation where new data points are created by perturbing the original ones,which has been impressively effective for tasks where the RL agent observe control states as images with perturbations including random cropping, shifting, etc. This work focuses on state-based control, where the RL agent can directly observe raw kinematic and task features, and considers an alternative data augmentation applied to these features based on Euclidean symmetries under transformations like rotations. We show that the default state features used in exiting benchmark tasks that are based on joint configurations are not amenable to Euclidean transformations. We therefore advocate using state features based on configurations of the limbs (i.e., rigid bodies connected by joints) that instead provides rich augmented data under Euclidean transformations. With minimal hyperparameter tuning, we show this new Euclidean data augmentation strategy significantly improve both data efficiency and asymptotic performance of RL on a wide range of continuous control tasks.</p>

This work focuses on protein interface prediction, which aims to determine whether a pair of residues from different proteins interact. Existing data-driven methods have made significant progress in effectively learning protein structures. Nevertheless, they overlook the conformational changes (i.e., flexibility) within proteins upon binding, leading to poor generalization ability. In this paper, we regard the protein flexibility as an attack on the trained model and aim to defend against it for improved generalization. To fulfill this purpose, we propose ATProt, an adversarial training framework for protein representations to robustly defend against the attack of protein flexibility. ATProt can theoretically guarantee protein representation stability under complicated protein flexibility. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that ATProt consistently improves the performance for protein interface prediction. Moreover, our method demonstrates broad applicability, performing the best even when provided with testing structures from structure prediction models like ESMFold and AlphaFold2.</p>

                        <p><p>One of the fundamental challenges for offline reinforcement learning (RL) is ensuring robustness to data distribution. Whether the data originates from a near-optimal policy or not, we anticipate that an algorithm should demonstrate its ability to learn an effective control policy that seamlessly aligns with the inherent distribution of offline data. Unfortunately, behavior regularization, a simple yet effective offline RL algorithm, tends to struggle in this regard. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that substantially enhances behavior-regularization based on conservative policy iteration. Our key observation is that by iteratively refining the reference policy used for behavior regularization, conservative policy update guarantees gradually improvement, while also implicitly avoiding querying out-of-sample actions to prevent catastrophic learning failures. We prove that in the tabular setting this algorithm is capable of learning the optimal policy covered by the offline dataset, commonly referred to as the in-sample optimal policy. We then explore several implementation details of the algorithm when function approximations are applied. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement, requiring only a few lines of code modification to existing methods. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark indicate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines in most tasks, clearly demonstrate its superiority over behavior regularization.</p>

                        <p><p>Gradient-variation online learning aims to achieve regret guarantees that scale with variations in the gradients of online functions, which is crucial for attaining fast convergence in games and robustness in stochastic optimization, hence receiving increased attention. Existing results often require the smoothness condition by imposing a fixed bound on gradient Lipschitzness, which may be unrealistic in practice. Recent efforts in neural network optimization suggest a generalized smoothness condition, allowing smoothness to correlate with gradient norms. In this paper, we systematically study gradient-variation online learning under generalized smoothness. We extend the classic optimistic mirror descent algorithm to derive gradient-variation regret by analyzing stability over the optimization trajectory and exploiting smoothness locally. Then, we explore universal online learning, designing a single algorithm with the optimal gradient-variation regrets for convex and strongly convex functions simultaneously, without requiring prior knowledge of curvature. This algorithm adopts a two-layer structure with a meta-algorithm running over a group of base-learners. To ensure favorable guarantees, we design a new Lipschitz-adaptive meta-algorithm, capable of handling potentially unbounded gradients while ensuring a second-order bound to effectively ensemble the base-learners. Finally, we provide the applications for fast-rate convergence in games and stochastic extended adversarial optimization.</p>

                        <p><p>When fine-tuning zero-shot models like CLIP, our desideratum is for the fine-tuned model to excel in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD). Recently, ensemble-based models (ESM) have been shown to offer significant robustness improvement, while preserving high ID accuracy. However, our study finds that ESMs do not solve the ID-OOD trade-offs: they achieve peak performance for ID and OOD accuracy at different mixing coefficients. When optimized for OOD accuracy, the ensemble model exhibits a noticeable decline in ID accuracy, and vice versa. In contrast, we propose a sample-wise ensembling technique that can simultaneously attain the best ID and OOD accuracy without the trade-offs. Specifically, we construct a Zero-Shot Failure (ZSF) set containing training samples incorrectly predicted by the zero-shot model. For each test sample, we calculate its distance to the ZSF set and assign a higher weight to the fine-tuned model in the ensemble if the distance is small. We term our method Variance Reduction Fine-tuning (VRF), as it effectively reduces the variance in ensemble predictions, thereby decreasing residual error. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, our VRF further improves the OOD accuracy by 1.5 - 2.0 pp over the ensemble baselines while maintaining or increasing ID accuracy. VRF achieves similar large robustness gains on (0.9 - 3.1 pp) on other distribution shifts19 benchmarks. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/VRF.</p>

                        <p><p>Drawing upon recent advances in language model alignment, we formulate offline Reinforcement Learning as a two-stage optimization problem: First pretraining expressive generative policies on reward-free behavior datasets, then finetuning these policies to align with task-specific annotations like Q-values. This strategy allows us to leverage abundant and diverse behavior data to enhance generalization and enable rapid adaptation to downstream tasks using minimal annotations. In particular, we introduce Efficient Diffusion Alignment (EDA) for solving continuous control problems. EDA utilizes diffusion models for behavior modeling. However, unlike previous approaches, we represent diffusion policies as the derivative of a scalar neural network with respect to action inputs. This representation is critical because it enables direct density calculation for diffusion models, making them compatible with existing LLM alignment theories. During policy fine-tuning, we extend preference-based alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align diffusion behaviors with continuous Q-functions. Our evaluation on the D4RL benchmark shows that EDA exceeds all baseline methods in overall performance. Notably, EDA maintains about 95\% of performance and still outperforms several baselines given only 1\% of Q-labelled data during fine-tuning.</p>

Most instruction tuning data come from human crowd-sourcing or GPT-4 distillation. We propose a paradigm to efficiently harvest 10 million naturally existing instruction data from the pre-training web corpus to enhance LLM reasoning. Our approach involves (1) recalling relevant documents, (2) extracting instruction-response pairs, and (3) refining the extracted pairs using open-source LLMs. Fine-tuning base LLMs on this dataset, we build MAmmoTH2 models, which significantly boost performance on reasoning benchmarks. Notably, MAmmoTH2-7B’s (Mistral) performance increases from 11% to 36.7% on MATH and from 36% to 68.4% on GSM8K without training on any in-domain data. Further training MAmmoTH2 on public instruction tuning datasets yields MAmmoTH2-Plus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several reasoning and chatbot benchmarks. Our work demonstrates how to harvest large-scale, high-quality instruction data without costly human annotation or GPT-4 distillation, providing a new paradigm for building better instruction tuning data.</p>

In this paradigm, outcomes must be embedded into the reals with dimension $d \approx n$ in order to design a consistent surrogate loss. Consistent losses are well-motivated theoretically, yet for large $n$, such as in information retrieval and structured prediction tasks, their optimization may be computationally infeasible. In practice, outcomes are typically embedded into some $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \ll n$, with little known about their suitability for multiclass classification. We investigate two approaches for trading off consistency and dimensionality in multiclass classification while using a convex surrogate loss. We first formalize partial consistency when the optimized surrogate has dimension $d \ll n$. We then check if partial consistency holds under a given embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding into $\mathbb{R}^d$. Finally, we present a new method to construct (fully) consistent losses with $d \ll n$ out of multiple problem instances. Our practical approach leverages parallelism to sidestep lower bounds on $d$.</p>

                        <p>This paper investigates a class of stochastic bilevel optimization problems where the upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. These problems have significant applications in sequential data learning, such as text classification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is characterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling linearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing state-of-the-art algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ oracle calls of stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further improve the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the population level also hold for each random realization almost surely (e.g., Lipschitzness of each realization of the stochastic gradient). To address this issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm named AccBO. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level variable by the stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with averaging. We prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Our proof relies on a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high probability for the lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and also plays a crucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over time. Experimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm achieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms baselines in bilevel optimization.</p>

                        <p><p>Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) is proposed to transfer knowledge from large-scale source-domain datasets to downstream target-domain datasets with only a few training samples. However, Vision Transformer (ViT), as a strong backbone network to achieve many top performances, is still under-explored in the CDFSL task in its transferability against large domain gaps. In this paper, we find an interesting phenomenon of ViT in the CDFSL task: by simply multiplying a temperature (even as small as 0) to the attention in ViT blocks, the target-domain performance consistently increases, even though the attention map is downgraded to a uniform map. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. Through experiments, we interpret this phenomenon as a remedy for the ineffective target-domain attention caused by the query-key attention mechanism under large domain gaps. Based on it, we further propose a simple but effective method for the CDFSL task to boost ViT's transferability by resisting the learning of query-key parameters and encouraging that of non-query-key ones. Experiments on four CDFSL datasets validate the rationale of our interpretation and method, showing we can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

                        <p><p>Flexible and accurate drag-based editing is a challenging task that has recently garnered significant attention. Current methods typically model this problem as automatically learning "how to drag" through point dragging and often produce one deterministic estimation, which presents two key limitations: 1) Overlooking the inherently ill-posed nature of drag-based editing, where multiple results may correspond to a given input, as illustrated in Fig.1; 2) Ignoring the constraint of image quality, which may lead to unexpected distortion.To alleviate this, we propose LucidDrag, which shifts the focus from "how to drag" to "what-then-how" paradigm.  LucidDrag comprises an intention reasoner and a collaborative guidance sampling mechanism. The former infers several optimal editing strategies, identifying what content and what semantic direction to be edited. Based on the former, the latter addresses "how to drag" by collaboratively integrating existing editing guidance with the newly proposed semantic guidance and quality guidance.Specifically, semantic guidance is derived by establishing a semantic editing direction based on reasoned intentions, while quality guidance is achieved through classifier guidance using an image fidelity discriminator.Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of LucidDrag over previous methods.</p>

                        <p><p>This paper studies the problem of rigid dynamics modeling, which has a wide range of applications in robotics, graphics, and mechanical design. The problem is partly solved by graph neural network (GNN) simulators. However, these approaches cannot effectively handle the relationship between intrinsic continuity and instantaneous changes in rigid dynamics. Moreover, they usually neglect hierarchical structures across mesh nodes and objects in systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Event-attend Graph ODE (EGODE) for effective rigid dynamics modeling. In particular, we describe the rigid system using both mesh node representations and object representations. To model continuous dynamics across hierarchical structures, we use a coupled graph ODE framework for the evolution of both types of representations over a long period. In addition, to capture instantaneous changes during the collision, we introduce an event module, which can effectively estimate the occurrence of the collision and update the states of both mesh node and object representations during evolution. Extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed EGODE compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

                        <p><p>While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit’s impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the fashion community.</p>

                        <p><p>Currently, vision encoder models like Vision Transformers (ViTs) typically excel at image recognition tasks but cannot simultaneously support text recognition like human visual recognition. To address this limitation, we propose UNIT, a novel training framework aimed at UNifying Image and Text recognition within a single model. Starting with a vision encoder pre-trained with image recognition tasks, UNIT introduces a lightweight language decoder for predicting text outputs and a lightweight vision decoder to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the original image encoding capabilities. The training process comprises two stages: intra-scale pretraining and inter-scale finetuning. During intra-scale pretraining, UNIT learns unified representations from multi-scale inputs, where images and documents are at their commonly used resolution, to enable fundamental recognition capability. In the inter-scale finetuning stage, the model introduces scale-exchanged data, featuring images and documents at resolutions different from the most commonly used ones, to enhance its scale robustness. Notably, UNIT retains the original vision encoder architecture, making it cost-free in terms of inference and deployment. Experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing methods on document-related tasks (e.g., OCR and DocQA) while maintaining the performances on natural images, demonstrating its ability to substantially enhance text recognition without compromising its core image recognition capabilities.</p>
